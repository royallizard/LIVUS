  Monitor([file_format[:urlbase],[fname_base],[options]]):
Used to start monitoring a channel. The channel's input and output
voice packets are logged to files until the channel hangs up or
monitoring is stopped by the StopMonitor application.
  file_format		optional, if not set, defaults to "wav"
  fname_base		if set, changes the filename used to the one specified.
  options:
    m   - when the recording ends mix the two leg files into one and
          delete the two leg files.  If the variable MONITOR_EXEC is set, the
          application referenced in it will be executed instead of
          sox and the raw leg files will NOT be deleted automatically.
          sox or MONITOR_EXEC is handed 3 arguments, the two leg files
          and a target mixed file name which is the same as the leg file names
          only without the in/out designator.
          If MONITOR_EXEC_ARGS is set, the contents will be passed on as
          additional arguments to MONITOR_EXEC
          Both MONITOR_EXEC and the Mix flag can be set from the
          administrator interface
    b   - Don't begin recording unless a call is bridged to another channel
    i   - Skip recording of input stream (disables m option)
    o   - Skip recording of output stream (disables m option)
By default, files are stored to /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/.
Returns -1 if monitor files can't be opened or if the channel is already
monitored, otherwise 0.
  StopMonitor():
Stops monitoring a channel. Has no effect if the channel is not monitored
  ChangeMonitor(filename_base):
Changes monitoring filename of a channel. Has no effect if the channel is not monitored.
The argument is the new filename base to use for monitoring this channel.
Change monitoring filename of a channel
  PauseMonitor():
Pauses monitoring of a channel until it is re-enabled by a call to UnpauseMonitor.
  UnpauseMonitor():
Unpauses monitoring of a channel on which monitoring had
previously been paused with PauseMonitor.
Unpause monitoring of a channel

Description: The 'Monitor' action may be used to record the audio on a
  specified channel.  The following parameters may be used to control
  this:
  Channel     - Required.  Used to specify the channel to record.
  File        - Optional.  Is the name of the file created in the
                monitor spool directory.  Defaults to the same name
                as the channel (with slashes replaced with dashes).
  Format      - Optional.  Is the audio recording format.  Defaults
                to "wav".
  Mix         - Optional.  Boolean parameter as to whether to mix
                the input and output channels together after the
                recording is finished.
Description: The 'StopMonitor' action may be used to end a previously
  started 'Monitor' action.  The only parameter is 'Channel', the name
  of the channel monitored.
Description: The 'ChangeMonitor' action may be used to change the file
  started by a previous 'Monitor' action.  The following parameters may
  be used to control this:
  Channel     - Required.  Used to specify the channel to record.
  File        - Required.  Is the new name of the file created in the
                monitor spool directory.
Description: The 'PauseMonitor' action may be used to temporarily stop the
 recording of a channel.  The following parameters may
 be used to control this:
  Channel     - Required.  Used to specify the channel to record.
Description: The 'UnpauseMonitor' action may be used to re-enable recording
  of a channel after calling PauseMonitor.  The following parameters may
  be used to control this:
  Channel     - Required.  Used to specify the channel to record.
