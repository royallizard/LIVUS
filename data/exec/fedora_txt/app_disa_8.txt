DISA (Direct Inward System Access) Application

DISA(<numeric passcode>[,<context>[,<cid>[,mailbox[,options]]]]) or
DISA(<filename>[,,,,options])
The DISA, Direct Inward System Access, application allows someone from 
outside the telephone switch (PBX) to obtain an "internal" system 
dialtone and to place calls from it as if they were placing a call from 
within the switch.
DISA plays a dialtone. The user enters their numeric passcode, followed by
the pound sign (#). If the passcode is correct, the user is then given
system dialtone within <context> on which a call may be placed. If the user
enters an invalid extension and extension "i" exists in the specified
context, it will be used.
If you need to present a DISA dialtone without entering a password, simply
set <passcode> to "no-password".
Be aware that using this may compromise the security of your PBX.
The arguments to this application (in extensions.conf) allow either
specification of a single global passcode (that everyone uses), or
individual passcodes contained in a file.
The file that contains the passcodes (if used) allows a complete
specification of all of the same arguments available on the command
line, with the sole exception of the options. The file may contain blank
lines, or comments starting with "#" or ";".
<context> specifies the dialplan context in which the user-entered extension
will be matched. If no context is specified, the DISA application defaults
the context to "disa". Presumably a normal system will have a special
context set up for DISA use with some or a lot of restrictions.
<cid> specifies a new (different) callerid to be used for this call.
<mailbox[@context]> will cause a stutter-dialtone (indication "dialrecall")
to be used, if the specified mailbox contains any new messages.
The following options are available:
  n - the DISA application will not answer initially.
  p - the extension entered will be considered complete when a '#' is entered.
