  Pickup([extension[@context][&extension2@[context]...]]):  This application can
pickup any ringing channel that is calling the specified extension.  If no
context is specified, the current context will be used. If you use the special
string "PICKUPMARK" for the context parameter, for example 10@PICKUPMARK,
this application tries to find a channel which has defined a ${PICKUPMARK}
channel variable with the same value as "extension" (in this example, "10").
When no parameter is specified, the application will pickup a channel matching
the pickup group of the active channel.
  PickupChan(channel[&channel...]): This application can pickup any ringing channel
