Usage: rrdcached [options]
Valid options are:
  -a <size>     Memory allocation chunk size. Default is 1.
  -B            Restrict file access to paths within -b <dir>
  -b <dir>      Base directory to change to.
  -F            Always flush all updates at shutdown
  -f <seconds>  Interval in which to flush dead data.
  -G <group>    Unprivileged group used when running.
  -g            Do not fork and run in the foreground.
  -j <dir>      Directory in which to create the journal files.
  -L            Open sockets on all INET interfaces using default port.
  -l <address>  Socket address to listen to.
                Default: unix:/tmp/rrdcached.sock
  -m <mode>     File permissions (octal) of all following UNIX sockets
  -O            Do not allow CREATE commands to overwrite existing
                files, even if asked to.
  -P <perms>    Sets the permissions to assign to all following sockets
  -p <file>     Location of the PID-file.
  -R            Allow recursive directory creation within -b <dir>
  -s <id|name>  Group owner of all following UNIX sockets
                (the socket will also have read/write permissions for that group)
  -t <threads>  Number of write threads.
  -U <user>     Unprivileged user account used when running.
  -w <seconds>  Interval in which to write data.
  -z <delay>    Delay writes up to <delay> seconds to spread load
For more information and a detailed description of all options please refer
to the rrdcached(1) manual page.
?a:Bb:Ff:gG:hj:Ll:m:OP:p:Rs:t:U:w:z:
WARNING: flush interval (-f) should be at least 2x write interval (-w) !
WARNING: write delay (-z) should NOT be larger than write interval (-w) !
WARNING: -B does not make sense without -b!
  Consult the rrdcached documentation
WARNING: -R does not make sense without -B!
  Consult the rrdcached documentation

UPDATE <filename> <values> [<values> ...]
Adds the given file to the internal cache if it is not yet known and
appends the given value(s) to the entry. See the rrdcached(1) manpage
for details.
Each <values> has the following form:
  <values> = <time>:<value>[:<value>[...]]
See the rrdupdate(1) manpage for details.
Adds the given filename to the head of the update queue and returns
after it has been dequeued.
Triggers writing of all pending updates.  Returns immediately.
Shows any 'pending' updates for a file, in order.
The updates shown have not yet been written to the underlying RRD file.
Removes the file completely from the cache.
Any pending updates for the file will be lost.
Shows all files in the output queue.
The output is zero or more lines in the following format:
(where <num_vals> is the number of values to be written)
<num_vals> <filename>
Returns some performance counters, see the rrdcached(1) manpage for
a description of the values.
The 'BATCH' command permits the client to initiate a bulk load
   of commands to rrdcached.
Usage:
    client: BATCH
    server: 0 Go ahead.  End with dot '.' on its own line.
    client: command #1
    client: command #2
    client: ... and so on
    client: .
    server: 2 errors
    server: 7 message for command #7
    server: 9 message for command #9
For more information, consult the rrdcached(1) documentation.
FETCH <file> <CF> [<start> [<end>] [<column>...]]
The 'FETCH' can be used by the client to retrieve values from an RRD file.
FETCHBIN <file> <CF> [<start> [<end>] [<column>...]]
The 'FETCHBIN' can be used by the client to retrieve values from an RRD file.
The INFO command retrieves information about a specified RRD file.
This is returned in standard rrdinfo format, a sequence of lines
with the format <keyname> = <value>
Note that this is the data as of the last update of the RRD file itself,
not the last time data was received via rrdcached, so there may be pending
updates in the queue.  If this bothers you, then first run a FLUSH.
The FIRST command retrieves the first data time for a specified RRA in
an RRD file.
The LAST command retrieves the last update time for a specified RRD file.
Note that this is the time of the last update of the RRD file itself, not
the last time data was received via rrdcached, so there may be pending
updates in the queue.  If this bothers you, then first run a FLUSH.
CREATE <filename> [-b start] [-s step] [-O] <DS definitions> <RRA definitions>
The CREATE command will create an RRD file, overwriting any existing file
unless the -O option is given or rrdcached was started with the -O option.
The start parameter needs to be in seconds since 1/1/70 (AT-style syntax is
not acceptable) and the step is in seconds (default is 300).
The DS and RRA definitions are as for the 'rrdtool create' command.
