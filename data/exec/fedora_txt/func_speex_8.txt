Noise reduction and Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
This paragraph is copyright (c) 2006 by Digium, Inc. In order for your module to load, it must return this key via a function called "key".  Any code which includes this paragraph must be licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later (at your option).  In addition to Digium's general reservations of rights, Digium expressly reserves the right to allow other parties to license this paragraph under different terms.

Apply automatic gain control to audio on a channel
  The AGC function will apply automatic gain control to audio on the channel
that this function is executed on.  Use rx for audio received from the channel
and tx to apply AGC to the audio being sent to the channel.  When using this
function, you set a target audio level.  It is primarily intended for use with
analog lines, but could be useful for other channels, as well.  The target volume
is set with a number between 1 and 32768.  Larger numbers are louder.
  Example Usage:
    Set(AGC(rx)=8000)
    Set(AGC(tx)=8000)
    Set(AGC(rx)=off)
    Set(AGC(tx)=off)
Apply noise reduction to audio on a channel
  The DENOISE function will apply noise reduction to audio on the channel
that this function is executed on.  It is especially useful for noisy analog
lines, especially when adjusting gains or using AGC.  Use rx for audio
received from the channel and tx to apply the filter to the audio being sent
to the channel.
  Example Usage:
    Set(DENOISE(rx)=on)
    Set(DENOISE(tx)=on)
    Set(DENOISE(rx)=off)
    Set(DENOISE(tx)=off)
