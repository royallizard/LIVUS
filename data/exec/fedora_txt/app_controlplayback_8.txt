  ControlPlayback(file[,skipms[,ff[,rew[,stop[,pause[,restart,options]]]]]]]):
This application will play back the given filename. By default, the '*' key
can be used to rewind, and the '#' key can be used to fast-forward.
Parameters:
  skipms  - This is number of milliseconds to skip when rewinding or
            fast-forwarding.
  ff      - Fast-forward when this DTMF digit is received.
  rew     - Rewind when this DTMF digit is received.
  stop    - Stop playback when this DTMF digit is received.
  pause   - Pause playback when this DTMF digit is received.
  restart - Restart playback when this DTMF digit is received.
Options:
  o(#) - Start at # ms from the beginning of the file.
This application sets the following channel variables upon completion:
  CPLAYBACKSTATUS -  This variable contains the status of the attempt as a text
                     string, one of: SUCCESS | USERSTOPPED | ERROR
  CPLAYBACKOFFSET -  This contains the offset in ms into the file where
                     playback was at when it stopped.  -1 is end of file.
  CPLAYBACKSTOPKEY - If the playback is stopped by the user this variable contains
                     the key that was pressed.
