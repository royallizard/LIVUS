CVE-2008-1948,2008-05-21T13:24:00.000,"The _gnutls_server_name_recv_params function in lib/ext_server_name.c in libgnutls in gnutls-serv in GnuTLS before 2.2.4 does not properly calculate the number of Server Names in a TLS 1.0 Client Hello message during extension handling, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a zero value for the length of Server Names, which leads to a buffer overflow in session resumption data in the pack_security_parameters function, aka GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1.",V2: 10.0
CVE-2008-1949,2008-05-21T13:24:00.000,"The _gnutls_recv_client_kx_message function in lib/gnutls_kx.c in libgnutls in gnutls-serv in GnuTLS before 2.2.4 continues to process Client Hello messages within a TLS message after one has already been processed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and crash) via a TLS message containing multiple Client Hello messages, aka GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2.",V2: 9.3
CVE-2008-1950,2008-05-21T13:24:00.000,"Integer signedness error in the _gnutls_ciphertext2compressed function in lib/gnutls_cipher.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.2.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and crash) via a certain integer value in the Random field in an encrypted Client Hello message within a TLS record with an invalid Record Length, which leads to an invalid cipher padding length, aka GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3.",V2: 5.0
CVE-2008-2377,2008-08-08T19:41:00.000,"Use-after-free vulnerability in the _gnutls_handshake_hash_buffers_clear function in lib/gnutls_handshake.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS 2.3.5 through 2.4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via TLS transmission of data that is improperly used when the peer calls gnutls_handshake within a normal session, leading to attempted access to a deallocated libgcrypt handle.",V2: 7.6
CVE-2008-4989,2008-11-13T01:00:01.177,"The _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.6.1 trusts certificate chains in which the last certificate is an arbitrary trusted, self-signed certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert a spoofed certificate for any Distinguished Name (DN).",V2: 4.3
CVE-2009-1415,2009-04-30T20:30:00.563,"lib/pk-libgcrypt.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not properly handle invalid DSA signatures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed DSA key that triggers a (1) free of an uninitialized pointer or (2) double free.",V2: 4.3
CVE-2009-1416,2009-04-30T20:30:00.577,"lib/gnutls_pk.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS 2.5.0 through 2.6.5 generates RSA keys stored in DSA structures, instead of the intended DSA keys, which might allow remote attackers to spoof signatures on certificates or have unspecified other impact by leveraging an invalid DSA key.",V2: 7.5
CVE-2009-1417,2009-04-30T20:30:00.593,"gnutls-cli in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not verify the activation and expiration times of X.509 certificates, which allows remote attackers to successfully present a certificate that is (1) not yet valid or (2) no longer valid, related to lack of time checks in the _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in libgnutls_x509, as used by (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup.",V2: 5.0
CVE-2009-2730,2009-08-12T10:30:01.360,"libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.8.2 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's (1) Common Name (CN) or (2) Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.",V2: 7.5
CVE-2012-1663,2012-03-13T22:55:03.067,Double free vulnerability in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 3.0.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted certificate list.,V2: 7.5
CVE-2012-1573,2012-03-26T19:55:01.390,"gnutls_cipher.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.12.17 and 3.x before 3.0.15 does not properly handle data encrypted with a block cipher, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted record, as demonstrated by a crafted GenericBlockCipher structure.",V2: 5.0
