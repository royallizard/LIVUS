register_log(callback[, data][, name]) -> identifier
Register a callback function for log messages.
'callback' is a callable object that will be called every time something
    is logged.
'data' is an optional object that will be passed back to the callback
    function every time it is called.
'name' is an optional identifier for this callback. The default name

'callback' is a callable object that will be called once collectd is
    shutting down.

    register this callback multiple time from the same module you need
    to specify a name here.
'identifier' is the full identifier assigned to this callback.

    data if it was supplied.
Unregisters a callback. This function needs exactly one parameter either
the function to unregister or the callback identifier to unregister.
This represents a piece of collectd's config file.
It is passed to scripts with config callbacks (see "register_config")
and is of little use if created somewhere else.
It has no methods beyond the bare minimum and only exists for its
data members
This represents the parent of this node. On the root node
of the config tree it will be None.
This is the keyword of this item, ie the first word of any
given line in the config file. It will always be a string.
This is a tuple (which might be empty) of all value, ie words
following the keyword in any given line in the config file.
Every item in this tuple will be either a string or a float or a bool,
depending on the contents of the configuration file.
This is a tuple of child nodes. For most nodes this will be
empty. If this node represents a block instead of a single line of the config
file it will contain all nodes in this block.
This is a long by another name. Use it in meta data dicts
to choose the way it is stored in the meta data.
This is a long by another name. Use it in meta data dicts
to choose the way it is stored in the meta data.
The Notification class is a wrapper around the collectd notification.
It can be used to notify other plugins about bad stuff happening. It works
similar to Values but has a severity and a message instead of interval
and time.
Notifications can be dispatched at any time and can be received with register_notification.
A Values object used for dispatching values to collectd and receiving values from write callbacks.
This is an internal class that is the base for Values
and Notification. It is pretty useless by itself and was therefore not
exported to the collectd module.
dispatch([type][, values][, plugin_instance][, type_instance][, plugin][, host][, time][, interval]) -> None.  Dispatch a value list.
Dispatch this instance to the collectd process. The object has members
for each of the possible arguments for this method. For a detailed explanation
of these parameters see the member of the same same.
If you do not submit a parameter the value saved in its member will be submitted.
If you do provide a parameter it will be used instead, without altering the member.
The severity of this notification. Assign or compare to
NOTIF_FAILURE, NOTIF_WARNING or NOTIF_OKAY.
Some kind of description what's going on and why this Notification was generated.
write([destination][, type][, values][, plugin_instance][, type_instance][, plugin][, host][, time][, interval]) -> None.  Dispatch a value list.
Write this instance to a single plugin or all plugins if 'destination' is obmitted.
This will bypass the main collectd process and all filtering and caching.
Other than that it works similar to 'dispatch'. In most cases 'dispatch' should be
used instead of 'write'.
The interval is the timespan in seconds between two submits for
the same data source. This value has to be a positive integer, so you can't
submit more than one value per second. If this member is set to a
non-positive value, the default value as specified in the config file will
be used (default: 10).
If you submit values more often than the specified interval, the average
will be used. If you submit less values, your graphs will have gaps.
These are the actual values that get dispatched to collectd.
It has to be a sequence (a tuple or list) of numbers.
The size of the sequence and the type of its content depend on the type
member your types.db file. For more information on this read the types.db
man page.
If the sequence does not have the correct size upon dispatch a RuntimeError
exception will be raised. If the content of the sequence is not a number,
a TypeError exception will be raised.
These are the meta data for this Value object.
It has to be a dictionary of numbers, strings or bools. All keys must be
strings. int and long objects will be dispatched as signed integers unless
they are between 2**63 and 2**64-1, which will result in a unsigned integer.
You can force one of these storage classes by using the classes
collectd.Signed and collectd.Unsigned. A meta object received by a write
callback will always contain Signed or Unsigned objects.
This is the Unix timestap of the time this value was read.
For dispatching values this can be set to 0 which means "now".
This means the time the value is actually dispatched, not the time
it was set to 0.
The hostname of the host this value was read from.
For dispatching this can be set to an empty string which means
the local hostname as defined in the collectd.conf.
The name of the plugin that read the data. Setting this
member to an empty string will insert "python" upon dispatching.
The type of this value. This type has to be defined
in your types.db. Attempting to set it to any other value will
raise a TypeError exception.
Assigning a type is mandetory, calling dispatch without doing
so will raise a RuntimeError exception.
