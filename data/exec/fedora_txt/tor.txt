You have a ControlPort set to accept unauthenticated connections from a non-local address.  This means that programs not running on your computer can reconfigure your Tor, without even having to guess a password.  That's so bad that I'm closing your ControlPort for you.  If you need to control your Tor remotely, try enabling authentication and using a tool like stunnel or ssh to encrypt remote access.
You have a ControlPort set to accept connections from a non-local address.  This means that programs not running on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's pretty bad, since the controller protocol isn't encrypted!  Maybe you should just listen on 127.0.0.1 and use a tool like stunnel or ssh to encrypt remote connections to your control port.

Failed to parse accounting options. See logs for details.
Using accounting with a hidden service and an ORPort is risky: your hidden service(s) and your public address will all turn off at the same time, which may alert observers that they are being run by the same party.
Using accounting with multiple hidden services is risky: they will all turn off at the same time, which may alert observers that they are being run by the same party.

You have configured more than one proxy type. (Socks4Proxy|Socks5Proxy|HTTPSProxy|ClientTransportPlugin)

Bad HashedControlPassword: wrong length or bad encoding

ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.
CookieAuthFileGroupReadable is set, but will have no effect: you must specify an explicit CookieAuthFile to have it group-readable.
Cannot enable UseEntryGuards with NumEntryGuards set to 0
Listing a family for a bridge relay is not supported: it can reveal bridge fingerprints to censors. You should also make sure you aren't listing this bridge's fingerprint in any other MyFamily.
Invalid nickname '%s' in %s line
You cannot set both DirServers and Alternate*Authority.
You have used DirServer or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
If you set UseBridges, you must specify at least one bridge.
If you set UseBridges, you must set TunnelDirConns.
Bridge line did not parse. See logs for details.
Transport line did not parse. See logs for details.
Server transport line did not parse. See logs for details.
Tor is not configured as a relay but you specified a ServerTransportPlugin line (%s). The ServerTransportPlugin line will be ignored.
ConstrainedSockSize is invalid.  Must be a value between %d and %d in 1024 byte increments.
You have requested constrained socket buffers while also serving directory entries via DirPort.  It is strongly suggested that you disable serving directory requests when system TCP buffer resources are scarce.
V3AuthVoteDelay plus V3AuthDistDelay must be less than half V3AuthVotingInterval
V3AuthVoteDelay is way too low.

V3AuthVotingInterval is insanely high.
V3AuthVotingInterval does not divide evenly into 24 hours.
Failed to configure rendezvous options. See logs for details.
Failed to configure client authorization for hidden services. See logs for details.
Must set TunnelDirConns if PreferTunneledDirConns is set.
When Socks4Proxy or Socks5Proxy is configured, PreferTunneledDirConns and TunnelDirConns must both be set to 1, or HTTPProxy must be configured.
TestingTorNetwork may only be configured in combination with a non-default set of DirServer or both of AlternateDirAuthority and AlternateBridgeAuthority configured.
You have set AllowSingleHopExits; now your relay will allow others to make one-hop exits. However, since by default most clients avoid relays that set this option, most clients will ignore you.
TestingV3AuthInitialVotingInterval may only be changed in testing Tor networks!
TestingV3AuthInitialVotingInterval is insanely low.

TestingEstimatedDescriptorPropagationTime must be non-negative.
TestingEstimatedDescriptorPropagationTime is insanely high.
TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!
Can't use hardware crypto accelerator dir without engine name.
You have passed a list of multiple arguments to the PublishServerDescriptor option that includes 0 or 1. 0 or 1 should only be used as the sole argument. This configuration will be rejected in a future release.
BridgeRelay is 1, ORPort is not set. This is an invalid combination.

We weren't able to find support for all of the TLS ciphersuites that we wanted to advertise. This won't hurt security, but it might make your Tor (if run as a client) more easy for censors to block.
To correct this, use a more recent OpenSSL, built without disabling any secure ciphers or features.

Initialized libevent version %s using method %s. Good.
There are serious bugs in using %s with libevent %s. Please use the latest version of libevent.
libevent %s can be very slow with %s. When running a server, please use the latest version of libevent.
There are minor bugs in using %s with libevent %s. You may want to use the latest version of libevent.
We were compiled with headers from version %s of Libevent, but we're using a Libevent library that says it's version %s.
I think these versions are binary-compatible.
This will almost certainly make Tor crash.
