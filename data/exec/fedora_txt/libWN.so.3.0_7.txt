Display synonyms and synsets related to synsets containing 
the search string.  If the search string is a pertainym the word 
or synset that it pertains to is displayed. 
A pertainym is a relational adverb that is derived from an adjective. 
Pertainym senses display the word that the search string is derived from 
and the adjective synset that contains the word.  If the adjective synset 
is a satellite synset, its head synset is also displayed. 
Display synonyms and synsets related to synsets containing 
the search string.  If the search string is in a head synset 
the 'cluster's' satellite synsets are displayed.  If the search 
string is in a satellite synset, its head synset is displayed. 
If the search string is a pertainym the word or synset that it 
pertains to is displayed. 
A cluster is a group of adjective synsets that are organized around 
antonymous pairs or triplets.  An adjective cluster contains two or more 
head synsets that contan antonyms.  Each head synset has one or more 
satellite synsets. 
A head synset contains at least one word that has a direct antonym 
in another head synset of the same cluster. 
A satellite synset represents a concept that is similar in meaning to 
the concept represented by its head synset. 
Direct antonyms are a pair of words between which there is an 
associative bond built up by co-occurrences. 
Direct antonyms are printed in parentheses following the adjective. 
The position of an adjective in relation to the noun may be restricted 
to the prenominal, postnominal or predicative position.  Where present 
these restrictions are noted in parentheses. 
A pertainym is a relational adjective, usually defined by such phrases 
as "of or pertaining to" and that does not have an antonym.  It pertains 
to a noun or another pertainym. 
Senses contained in head synsets are displayed above the satellites, 
which are indented and preceded by "=>".  Senses contained in 
satellite synsets are displayed with the head synset below.  The head 
synset is preceded by "=>". 
Pertainym senses display the word or synsets that the search string 
pertains to. 
Display synsets containing antonyms of the search string. If the 
search string is in a head synset the direct antonym is displayed 
along with the head synset's satellite synsets.  If the search 
string is in a satellite synset, its indirect antonym is displayed 
via the head synset 
A head synset contains at least one word that has a direct antonym 
in another head synset of the same cluster. 
A satellite synset represents a concept that is similar in meaning to 
the concept represented by its head synset. 
Direct antonyms are a pair of words between which there is an 
associative bond built up by co-occurrences. 
Direct antonyms are printed in parentheses following the adjective. 
The position of an adjective in relation to the noun may be restricted 
to the prenominal, postnominal or predicative position.  Where present 
these restrictions are noted in parentheses. 
Senses contained in head synsets are displayed, followed by the 
head synset containing the search string's direct antonym and its 
similar synsets, which are indented and preceded by "=>".  Senses 
contained in satellite synsets are displayed followed by the indirect 
antonym via the satellite's head synset.

Display applicable verb sentence frames for the search string. 
A frame is a sentence template illustrating the usage of a verb. 
Verb sentence frames are preceded with the string "*>" if a sentence 
frame is acceptable for all of the words in the synset, and with "=>" 
if a sentence frame is acceptable for the search string only.  
Some verb senses have example sentences.  These are preceeded with "EX:". 
Recursively display CAUSE TO relations of the search string. 
The action represented by the verb X causes the action represented by 
the verb Y.

unless Y is, or has been, done. 
Entailment synsets are preceded by "=>", and are indented from the left 
according to their level in the hierarchy. 
Display hyponym tree for the search string.  This is 
a recursive search that finds the hyponyms of each hyponym.  
For verbs, hyponyms are refered to as troponyms.  Troponyms indicate particular ways 
to perform a function.  X is a hyponym of Y if to X is a particular way to Y. 
Troponym synsets are preceded by "=>", and are indented from the left 
according to their level in the hierarchy. 
Display nouns that are attributes of search string. 
Display adjectives for which search string is an attribute. 
Display all synsets belonging to the domain. 
Each domain term synset is preceeded by "TOPIC TERM", "REGION TERM", or 
"USAGE TERM" to distinguish topical, geographic and functional classes, 
and its part of speech. Each word is followed by its sense number. 
Display domain to which this synset belongs. 
Each domain synset is preceeded by "TOPIC", "REGION", or "USAGE" to 
distinguish topical, geographic and functional classifications, and 
it's part of speech.  Each word is followed by its sense number. 
Display derived forms - nouns and verbs that are related morphologically. 
Each related synset is preceeded by its part of speech. Each word in the 
synset is followed by its sense number. 
Display meronyms for search string tree.  This is a recursive search 
the prints all the meronyms of the search string and all of its 
hypernyms.  
A meronym is the name of a constituent part, the substance of, or a 
member of something.  X is a meronym of Y if X is a part of Y. 
A holonym is the name of the whole of which the meronym names a part. 
Y is a holonym of X if X is a part of Y. 
Hypernym is the generic term used to designate a whole class of 
specific instances.  Y is a hypernym of X if X is a (kind of) Y. 
Meronym synsets are preceded with either the string "HAS MEMBER", 
"HAS PART" or "HAS SUBSTANCE" depending on the specific type of 
holonym.  Synsets are indented from the left according to their level 
in the hierarchy. 
Display all meronyms of the search string.  
A meronym is the name of a constituent part, the substance of, or a 
member of something.  X is a meronym of Y if X is a part of Y.
