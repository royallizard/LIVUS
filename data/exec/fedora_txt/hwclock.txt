update-drift
Not adjusting drift factor because the --update-drift option was not used.
Not adjusting drift factor because the Hardware Clock previously contained garbage.
Not adjusting drift factor because last calibration time is zero,
so history is bad and calibration startover is necessary.
Not adjusting drift factor because it has been less than four hours since the last calibration.
Clock drift factor was calculated as %f seconds/day.
It is far too much. Resetting to zero.
Clock drifted %f seconds in the past %f seconds
in spite of a drift factor of %f seconds/day.
Adjusting drift factor by %f seconds/day
Warning: unrecognized third line in adjtime file
(Expected: `UTC' or `LOCAL' or nothing.)
Last drift adjustment done at %ld seconds after 1969

Invalid values in hardware clock: %4d/%.2d/%.2d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d
Hw clock time : %4d/%.2d/%.2d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d = %ld seconds since 1969
Assuming hardware clock is kept in %s time.
time jumped backward %.6f seconds to %ld.%06d - retargeting
missed it - %ld.%06d is too far past %ld.%06d (%.6f > %.6f)
%ld.%06d is close enough to %ld.%06d (%.6f < %.6f)
Set RTC to %ld (%ld + %d; refsystime = %ld.%06d)
Setting Hardware Clock to %.2d:%.2d:%.2d = %ld seconds since 1969
Clock not changed - testing only.
The Hardware Clock registers contain values that are either invalid (e.g. 50th day of month) or beyond the range we can handle (e.g. Year 2095).
Time read from Hardware Clock: %4d/%.2d/%.2d %02d:%02d:%02d
Time since last adjustment is %d seconds
Time since last adjustment is %d second
Calculated Hardware Clock drift is %ld.%06d seconds
The Hardware Clock does not contain a valid time, so we cannot adjust it.
Not setting clock because last adjustment time is zero, so history is bad.
Not setting clock because drift factor %f is far too high.
Needed adjustment is less than one second, so not setting clock.
The Hardware Clock does not contain a valid time, so we cannot set the System Time from it.
	tv.tv_sec = %ld, tv.tv_usec = %ld
Not setting system clock because running in test mode.
Must be superuser to set system clock.
Current system time: %ld = %s
At %ld seconds after 1969, RTC is predicted to read %ld seconds after 1969.
Not updating adjtime file because of testing mode.

Could not open file with the clock adjustment parameters in it (%s) for writing
Could not update file with the clock adjustment parameters (%s) in it
Drift adjustment parameters not updated.
 hwclock [function] [option...]
Query or set the hardware clock.
 -h, --help           show this help text and exit
 -r, --show           read hardware clock and print result
     --get            read hardware clock and print drift corrected result
     --set            set the RTC to the time given with --date
 -s, --hctosys        set the system time from the hardware clock
 -w, --systohc        set the hardware clock from the current system time
     --systz          set the system time based on the current timezone
     --adjust         adjust the RTC to account for systematic drift since
                        the clock was last set or adjusted
 -c, --compare        periodically compare the system clock with the CMOS clock
     --getepoch       print out the kernel's hardware clock epoch value
     --setepoch       set the kernel's hardware clock epoch value to the 
                        value given with --epoch
     --predict        predict RTC reading at time given with --date
 -V, --version        display version information and exit

     --localtime      the hardware clock is kept in local time
 -f, --rtc <file>     special /dev/... file to use instead of default
     --directisa      access the ISA bus directly instead of %s
     --badyear        ignore RTC's year because the BIOS is broken
     --date <time>    specifies the time to which to set the hardware clock
     --epoch <year>   specifies the year which is the beginning of the
                        hardware clock's epoch value
     --update-drift   update drift factor in %1$s (requires
                        --set or --systohc)
     --noadjfile      do not access %1$s; this requires the use of
                        either --utc or --localtime
     --adjfile <file> specifies the path to the adjust file;
                        the default is %1$s
     --test           do not update anything, just show what would happen

%s: these options are mutually exclusive:
Sorry, only the superuser can use the Hardware Clock.
%s takes no non-option arguments.  You supplied %d.
With --noadjfile, you must specify either --utc or --localtime
The value of the --date option is not a valid date.
In particular, it contains quotation marks.
date --date="%s" +seconds-into-epoch=%%s
Unable to run 'date' program in /bin/sh shell. popen() failed
response from date command = %s
The date command issued by %s returned unexpected results.
The command was:
  %s
The response was:
  %s
The date command issued by %s returned something other than an integer where the converted time value was expected.
The command was:
  %s
The response was:
date string %s equates to %ld seconds since 1969.
No usable set-to time.  Cannot set clock.
The kernel keeps an epoch value for the Hardware Clock only on an Alpha machine.
This copy of hwclock was built for a machine other than Alpha
(and thus is presumably not running on an Alpha now).  No action taken.
No usable clock interface found.
Cannot access the Hardware Clock via any known method.
Use the --debug option to see the details of our search for an access method.
