    RandomState(seed=None)
    Container for the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator.
    `RandomState` exposes a number of methods for generating random numbers
    drawn from a variety of probability distributions. In addition to the
    distribution-specific arguments, each method takes a keyword argument
    `size` that defaults to ``None``. If `size` is ``None``, then a single
    value is generated and returned. If `size` is an integer, then a 1-D
    array filled with generated values is returned. If `size` is a tuple,
    then an array with that shape is filled and returned.
    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        Random seed initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
        Can be an integer, an array (or other sequence) of integers of
        any length, or ``None`` (the default).
        If `seed` is ``None``, then `RandomState` will try to read data from
        ``/dev/urandom`` (or the Windows analogue) if available or seed from
        the clock otherwise.
    Notes
    -----
    The Python stdlib module "random" also contains a Mersenne Twister
    pseudo-random number generator with a number of methods that are similar
    to the ones available in `RandomState`. `RandomState`, besides being
    NumPy-aware, has the advantage that it provides a much larger number
    of probability distributions to choose from.

        first index.
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : int or array_like
            If `x` is an integer, randomly permute ``np.arange(x)``.

            randomly.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Permuted sequence or array range.
        Examples

        array([1, 7, 4, 3, 0, 9, 2, 5, 8, 6])
        >>> np.random.permutation([1, 4, 9, 12, 15])
        array([15,  1,  9,  4, 12])
        >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
        >>> np.random.permutation(arr)
        array([[6, 7, 8],
               [0, 1, 2],
               [3, 4, 5]])

        Modify a sequence in-place by shuffling its contents.
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like
            The array or list to be shuffled.
        Returns
        -------
        None
        Examples
        --------
        >>> arr = np.arange(10)
        >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
        >>> arr
        [1 7 5 2 9 4 3 6 0 8]
        This function only shuffles the array along the first index of a
        multi-dimensional array:
        >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
        >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
        >>> arr
        array([[3, 4, 5],
               [6, 7, 8],
               [0, 1, 2]])
        
        dirichlet(alpha, size=None)
        Draw samples from the Dirichlet distribution.
        Draw `size` samples of dimension k from a Dirichlet distribution. A
        Dirichlet-distributed random variable can be seen as a multivariate
        generalization of a Beta distribution. Dirichlet pdf is the conjugate
        prior of a multinomial in Bayesian inference.
        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : array
            Parameter of the distribution (k dimension for sample of
            dimension k).
        size : array
            Number of samples to draw.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray,
            The drawn samples, of shape (alpha.ndim, size).
        Notes
        -----
        .. math:: X \approx \prod_{i=1}^{k}{x^{\alpha_i-1}_i}
        Uses the following property for computation: for each dimension,
        draw a random sample y_i from a standard gamma generator of shape
        `alpha_i`, then
        :math:`X = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^k{y_i}} (y_1, \ldots, y_n)` is
        Dirichlet distributed.

        Taking an example cited in Wikipedia, this distribution can be used if
        one wanted to cut strings (each of initial length 1.0) into K pieces
        with different lengths, where each piece had, on average, a designated
        average length, but allowing some variation in the relative sizes of the
        pieces.

        multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)
        Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
        The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the
        binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
        possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
        where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
        distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
        ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome
        was ``i``.
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Number of experiments.
        pvals : sequence of floats, length p
            Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
            should sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
            account for the remaining probability, as long as
            ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
        size : tuple of ints
            Given a `size` of ``(M, N, K)``, then ``M*N*K`` samples are drawn,
            and the output shape becomes ``(M, N, K, p)``, since each sample
            has shape ``(p,)``.
        Examples
        --------
        Throw a dice 20 times:
        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
        array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])
        It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
        Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
        array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3],
               [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])
        For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
        we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
        A loaded dice is more likely to land on number 6:
        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5)
        array([13, 16, 13, 16, 42])
        
        multivariate_normal(mean, cov[, size])
        Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
        The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
        generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
        dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
        covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
        (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
        squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
            Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
        cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
            Covariance matrix of the distribution.  Must be symmetric and
            positive-semidefinite for "physically meaningful" results.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
            generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
            each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
            If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
            the shape is ``(N,)``.
            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
            value drawn from the distribution.
        Notes
        -----
        The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
        location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
        analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
        univariate normal distribution.
        Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
        From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
        samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
        element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
        The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
        "spread").
        Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
        approximations include:
          - Spherical covariance (*cov* is a multiple of the identity matrix)
          - Diagonal covariance (*cov* has non-negative elements, and only on
            the diagonal)
        This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
        generated data-points:
        >>> mean = [0,0]
        >>> cov = [[1,0],[0,100]] # diagonal covariance, points lie on x or y-axis
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> x,y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,5000).T
        >>> plt.plot(x,y,'x'); plt.axis('equal'); plt.show()
        Note that the covariance matrix must be non-negative definite.

        logseries(p, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Logarithmic Series distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Log Series distribution with specified
        parameter, p (probability, 0 < p < 1).
        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
        scale : float > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------

        The probability density for the Log Series distribution is
        .. math:: P(k) = \frac{-p^k}{k \ln(1-p)},
        where p = probability.
        The Log Series distribution is frequently used to represent species
        richness and occurrence, first proposed by Fisher, Corbet, and
        Williams in 1943 [2].  It may also be used to model the numbers of
        occupants seen in cars [3].

        hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsample, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Hypergeometric distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Hypergeometric distribution with specified
        parameters, ngood (ways to make a good selection), nbad (ways to make
        a bad selection), and nsample = number of items sampled, which is less
        than or equal to the sum ngood + nbad.
        Parameters
        ----------
        ngood : int or array_like
            Number of ways to make a good selection.  Must be nonnegative.
        nbad : int or array_like
            Number of ways to make a bad selection.  Must be nonnegative.
        nsample : int or array_like
            Number of items sampled.  Must be at least 1 and at most
            ``ngood + nbad``.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            The values are all integers in  [0, n].
        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.distributions.hypergeom : probability density function,
            distribution or cumulative density function, etc.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
        .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{m}{n}\binom{N-m}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}},
        where :math:`0 \le x \le m` and :math:`n+m-N \le x \le n`
        for P(x) the probability of x successes, n = ngood, m = nbad, and
        N = number of samples.
        Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, ngood of them
        black and nbad are white. If you draw nsample balls without
        replacement, then the Hypergeometric distribution describes the
        distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
        Note that this distribution is very similar to the Binomial
        distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
        replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
        replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
        becomes large, this distribution approaches the Binomial.

        # number of good, number of bad, and number of samples

        geometric(p, size=None)
        Draw samples from the geometric distribution.
        Bernoulli trials are experiments with one of two outcomes:
        success or failure (an example of such an experiment is flipping
        a coin).  The geometric distribution models the number of trials
        that must be run in order to achieve success.  It is therefore
        supported on the positive integers, ``k = 1, 2, ...``.
        The probability mass function of the geometric distribution is
        .. math:: f(k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p
        where `p` is the probability of success of an individual trial.
        Parameters
        ----------
        p : float
            The probability of success of an individual trial.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Samples from the geometric distribution, shaped according to
            `size`.
        Examples
        --------
        Draw ten thousand values from the geometric distribution,
        with the probability of an individual success equal to 0.35:
        >>> z = np.random.geometric(p=0.35, size=10000)
        How many trials succeeded after a single run?
        >>> (z == 1).sum() / 10000.

        zipf(a, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Zipf distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Zipf distribution with specified parameter
        `a` > 1.
        The Zipf distribution (also known as the zeta distribution) is a
        continuous probability distribution that satisfies Zipf's law: the
        frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank in a
        frequency table.
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float > 1
            Distribution parameter.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : scalar or ndarray
            The returned samples are greater than or equal to one.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Zipf distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{x^{-a}}{\zeta(a)},
        where :math:`\zeta` is the Riemann Zeta function.
        It is named for the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who noted
        that the frequency of any word in a sample of a language is inversely
        proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> a = 2. # parameter
        >>> s = np.random.zipf(a, 1000)
        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> import scipy.special as sps
        Truncate s values at 50 so plot is interesting
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s[s<50], 50, normed=True)
        >>> x = np.arange(1., 50.)
        >>> y = x**(-a)/sps.zetac(a)
        >>> plt.plot(x, y/max(y), linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()
        
        poisson(lam=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Poisson distribution.
        The Poisson distribution is the limit of the Binomial
        distribution for large N.
        Parameters
        ----------
        lam : float or sequence of float
            Expectation of interval, should be >= 0. A sequence of expectation
            intervals must be broadcastable over the requested size.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Notes
        -----
        The Poisson distribution
        .. math:: f(k; \lambda)=\frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
        For events with an expected separation :math:`\lambda` the Poisson
        distribution :math:`f(k; \lambda)` describes the probability of
        :math:`k` events occurring within the observed interval :math:`\lambda`.
        Because the output is limited to the range of the C long type, a
        ValueError is raised when `lam` is within 10 sigma of the maximum
        representable value.

        negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)
        Draw samples from a negative_binomial distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a negative_Binomial distribution with specified
        parameters, `n` trials and `p` probability of success where `n` is an
        integer > 0 and `p` is in the interval [0, 1].
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Parameter, > 0.
        p : float
            Parameter, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : int or ndarray of ints
            Drawn samples.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Negative Binomial distribution is
        .. math:: P(N;n,p) = \binom{N+n-1}{n-1}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},
        where :math:`n-1` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the probability
        of success, and :math:`N+n-1` is the number of trials.
        The negative binomial distribution gives the probability of n-1 successes
        and N failures in N+n-1 trials, and success on the (N+n)th trial.
        If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears, then the
        probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that appear before the
        third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

        binomial(n, p, size=None)
        Draw samples from a binomial distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Binomial distribution with specified
        parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
        n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
        input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : float (but truncated to an integer)
                parameter, >= 0.
        p : float
                parameter, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Binomial distribution is
        .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
        where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
        of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
        When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
        using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
        product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
        number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
        instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
        handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
        so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

        triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)

        The triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with

        distributions, these parameters directly define the shape of the pdf.
        Parameters

            Lower limit.
        mode : scalar
            The value where the peak of the distribution occurs.
            The value should fulfill the condition ``left <= mode <= right``.
        right : scalar
            Upper limit, should be larger than `left`.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a

        Returns

        The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined problems where the
        underlying distribution is not known, but some knowledge of the limits and
        mode exists. Often it is used in simulations.

        wald(mean, scale, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Wald, or Inverse Gaussian, distribution.
        As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
        Gaussian.
        Some references claim that the Wald is an Inverse Gaussian with mean=1, but
        this is by no means universal.
        The Inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name Inverse Gaussian
        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a unit
        distance and distance covered in unit time.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : scalar
            Distribution mean, should be > 0.
        scale : scalar
            Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn sample, all greater than zero.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                    \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
        As noted above the Inverse Gaussian distribution first arise from attempts
        to model Brownian Motion. It is also a competitor to the Weibull for use in
        reliability modeling and modeling stock returns and interest rate
        processes.

        Rayleigh.
        Parameters
        ----------

            Scale, also equals the mode. Should be >= 0.

        The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is
        .. math:: P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}
        The Rayleigh distribution arises if the wind speed and wind direction are
        both gaussian variables, then the vector wind velocity forms a Rayleigh
        distribution. The Rayleigh distribution is used to model the expected
        output from wind turbines.

        lognormal(mean=0.0, sigma=1.0, size=None)
        Return samples drawn from a log-normal distribution.
        Draw samples from a log-normal distribution with specified mean,
        standard deviation, and array shape.  Note that the mean and standard
        deviation are not the values for the distribution itself, but of the
        underlying normal distribution it is derived from.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : float
            Mean value of the underlying normal distribution
        sigma : float, > 0.
            Standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or float
            The desired samples. An array of the same shape as `size` if given,
            if `size` is None a float is returned.

        Notes
        -----
        A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
        distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
        distribution is:
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                         e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
        where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
        deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
        A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
        of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
        the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
        *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
        variables.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
        scale : float > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional

        Returns

        Notes

        The Logistic distribution is used in Extreme Value problems where it
        can act as a mixture of Gumbel distributions, in Epidemiology, and by
        the World Chess Federation (FIDE) where it is used in the Elo ranking
        system, assuming the performance of each player is a logistically
        distributed random variable.

        -----
        The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme Value
        Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)
        distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.  The Gumbel is a
        special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution for maximums from
        distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
        The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
                  \beta}},
        where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and :math:`\beta` is
        the scale parameter.
        The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
        very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
        flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and rainfall
        rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of an event in
        the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a Gaussian, hence
        the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year floods. Floods were
        initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which underestimated the frequency
        of extreme events.
        It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
        Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
        Frechet.
        The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance of
        :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

        laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
        specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).
        The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
        but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
        difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
        random variables.
        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
            The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak.
        scale : float
            :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Notes
        -----
        It has the probability density function
        .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
                                       \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).
        The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency of an error
        can be expressed as an exponential function of the absolute magnitude of
        the error, which leads to the Laplace distribution. For many problems in
        Economics and Health sciences, this distribution seems to model the data
        better than the standard Gaussian distribution

        Draws samples in [0, 1] from a power distribution with positive
        exponent a - 1.
        Also known as the power function distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float
            parameter, > 0
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : {ndarray, scalar}
            The returned samples lie in [0, 1].
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If a<1.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function is
        .. math:: P(x; a) = ax^{a-1}, 0 \le x \le 1, a>0.
        The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
        distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
        distribution.
        It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
        claims.

        weibull(a, size=None)
        Weibull distribution.
        Draw samples from a 1-parameter Weibull distribution with the given
        shape parameter `a`.
        .. math:: X = (-ln(U))^{1/a}
        Here, U is drawn from the uniform distribution over (0,1].
        The more common 2-parameter Weibull, including a scale parameter
        :math:`\lambda` is just :math:`X = \lambda(-ln(U))^{1/a}`.
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float
            Shape of the distribution.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Notes
        -----
        The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution for smallest
        values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler distribution) is one of a class of
        Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme
        value problems.  This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.
        The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
                         {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},
        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
        The function has its peak (the mode) at
        :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
        When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
        distribution.

        pareto(a, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with specified shape.
        The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto distribution. The
        classical Pareto distribution can be obtained from the Lomax distribution
        by adding 1 and multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).
        The smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard Pareto
        distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also be considered as a
        simplified version of the Generalized Pareto distribution (available in
        SciPy), with the scale set to one and the location set to zero.
        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is unbounded above.
        It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In this distribution, 80 percent of
        the weights are in the lowest 20 percent of the range, while the other 20
        percent fill the remaining 80 percent of the range.
        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : float, > 0.
            Shape of the distribution.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Pareto distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}
        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.
        The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto,
        is a power law probability distribution useful in many real world problems.
        Outside the field of economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe the
        distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found use in insurance,
        web page access statistics, oil field sizes, and many other problems,
        including the download frequency for projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is
        one of the so-called "fat-tailed" distributions.

        vonmises(mu, kappa, size=None)
        Draw samples from a von Mises distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a von Mises distribution with specified mode
        (mu) and dispersion (kappa), on the interval [-pi, pi].
        The von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal
        distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the unit
        circle.  It may be thought of as the circular analogue of the normal
        distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mu : float
            Mode ("center") of the distribution.
        kappa : float
            Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : scalar or ndarray
            The returned samples, which are in the interval [-pi, pi].

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the von Mises distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},
        where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
        and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.
        The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
        Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
        States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
        probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of
        science.

        standard_t(df, size=None)
        Standard Student's t distribution with df degrees of freedom.
        A special case of the hyperbolic distribution.
        As `df` gets large, the result resembles that of the standard normal
        distribution (`standard_normal`).
        Parameters
        ----------
        df : int
            Degrees of freedom, should be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the t distribution is
        .. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
                  \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}
        The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a Normal
        distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether the sample mean
        (that is the mean calculated from the data) is a good estimate of the true
        mean.
        The derivation of the t-distribution was forst published in 1908 by William
        Gisset while working for the Guinness Brewery in Dublin. Due to proprietary
        issues, he had to publish under a pseudonym, and so he used the name
        Student.

        Examples
        --------
        From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
        women in Kj is:
        >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
        ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])
        Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
        value of 7725 kJ?
        We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the
        recommended value?
        >>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=100000)
        >>> np.mean(intake)
        6753.636363636364
        >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
        1142.1232221373727
        Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
        value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of
        freedom, N-1.
        >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, normed=True)
        For a one-sided t-test, how far out in the distribution does the t
        statistic appear?
        >>> >>> np.sum(s<t) / float(len(s))
        0.0090699999999999999  #random
        So the p-value is about 0.009, which says the null hypothesis has a
        probability of about 99% of being true.
        
        standard_cauchy(size=None)
        Standard Cauchy distribution with mode = 0.
        Also known as the Lorentz distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            The drawn samples.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is
        .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
                  (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }
        and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
        :math:`\gamma=1`
        The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
        oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
        also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
        a random angle will cut the x axis.
        When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
        tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
        their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
        very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

        noncentral_chisquare(df, nonc, size=None)

        The noncentral :math:`\chi^2` distribution is a generalisation of
        the :math:`\chi^2` distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------

            single value is returned.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the noncentral Chi-square distribution
        is
        .. math:: P(x;df,nonc) = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}
                               \frac{e^{-nonc/2}(nonc/2)^{i}}{i!}P_{Y_{df+2i}}(x),
        where :math:`Y_{q}` is the Chi-square with q degrees of freedom.
        In Delhi (2007), it is noted that the noncentral chi-square is useful in
        bombing and coverage problems, the probability of killing the point target

        chisquare(df, size=None)
        Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.
        When `df` independent random variables, each with standard normal
        distributions (mean 0, variance 1), are squared and summed, the
        resulting distribution is chi-square (see Notes).  This distribution
        is often used in hypothesis testing.
        Parameters
        ----------
        df : int
             Number of degrees of freedom.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        output : ndarray
            Samples drawn from the distribution, packed in a `size`-shaped
            array.
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            When `df` <= 0 or when an inappropriate `size` (e.g. ``size=-1``)
            is given.
        Notes
        -----
        The variable obtained by summing the squares of `df` independent,
        standard normally distributed random variables:
        .. math:: Q = \sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{df}} X^2_i
        is chi-square distributed, denoted
        .. math:: Q \sim \chi^2_k.
        The probability density function of the chi-squared distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{(1/2)^{k/2}}{\Gamma(k/2)}
                         x^{k/2 - 1} e^{-x/2},
        where :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function,
        .. math:: \Gamma(x) = \int_0^{-\infty} t^{x - 1} e^{-t} dt.

        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
        freedom in denominator), where both parameters > 1.

        Returns
        -------
        samples : scalar or ndarray

        Notes
        -----
        When calculating the power of an experiment (power = probability of
        rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative is true) the
        non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is
        true, the F statistic follows a central F distribution. When the null
        hypothesis is not true, then it follows a non-central F statistic.

        Examples
        --------
        In a study, testing for a specific alternative to the null hypothesis
        requires use of the Noncentral F distribution. We need to calculate the
        area in the tail of the distribution that exceeds the value of the F
        distribution for the null hypothesis.  We'll plot the two probability
        distributions for comparison.

        f(dfnum, dfden, size=None)
        Draw samples from a F distribution.
        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of freedom
        in denominator), where both parameters should be greater than zero.
        The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
        Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
        that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
        variates.
        Parameters
        ----------
        dfnum : float
            Degrees of freedom in numerator. Should be greater than zero.
        dfden : float
            Degrees of freedom in denominator. Should be greater than zero.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : {ndarray, scalar}
            Samples from the Fisher distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
        variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
        so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
        problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
        between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
        degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
        minus the number of groups.

        Examples
        --------
        An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40.
        Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
        without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
        case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
        82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
        data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
        status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
        Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
        >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
        >>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)
        The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :
        >>> sort(s)[-10]
        7.61988120985
        So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
        the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
        level.
        
        gamma(shape, scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Gamma distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
        `shape` (sometimes designated "k") and `scale` (sometimes designated
        "theta"), where both parameters are > 0.
        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : scalar > 0
            The shape of the gamma distribution.
        scale : scalar > 0, optional
            The scale of the gamma distribution.  Default is equal to 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray, float
            Returns one sample unless `size` parameter is specified.

        The probability density for the Gamma distribution is

        where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
        and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
        The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
        electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
        waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

        with a scale parameter of 1.
        Parameters

        exponential(scale=1.0, size=None)
        Exponential distribution.
        Its probability density function is
        .. math:: f(x; \frac{1}{\beta}) = \frac{1}{\beta} \exp(-\frac{x}{\beta}),
        for ``x > 0`` and 0 elsewhere. :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter,
        which is the inverse of the rate parameter :math:`\lambda = 1/\beta`.
        The rate parameter is an alternative, widely used parameterization
        of the exponential distribution [3]_.
        The exponential distribution is a continuous analogue of the
        geometric distribution.  It describes many common situations, such as
        the size of raindrops measured over many rainstorms [1]_, or the time
        between page requests to Wikipedia [2]_.
        Parameters
        ----------
        scale : float
            The scale parameter, :math:`\beta = 1/\lambda`.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        beta(a, b, size=None)
        The Beta distribution over ``[0, 1]``.
        The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
        and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
        distribution function
        .. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
                                                         (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},
        where the normalisation, B, is the beta function,
        .. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
                                     (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.
        It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float
            Alpha, non-negative.
        b : float
            Beta, non-negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Array of the given shape, containing values drawn from a
            Beta distribution.
        
        normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
        The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
        derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
        independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
        its characteristic shape (see the example below).
        The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
        describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
        by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
        unique distribution [2]_.
        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
            Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
        scale : float
            Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is

        where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard deviation.
        The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`, is called the
        variance.
        The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
        the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
        :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
        `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to the
        mean, rather than those far away.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> mu, sigma = 0, 0.1 # mean and standard deviation
        >>> s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)
        Verify the mean and the variance:
        >>> abs(mu - np.mean(s)) < 0.01
        True
        >>> abs(sigma - np.std(s, ddof=1)) < 0.01
        True
        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 30, normed=True)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, 1/(sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
        ...                np.exp( - (bins - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2) ),

        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        random_integers(low, high=None, size=None)
        Return random integers between `low` and `high`, inclusive.
        Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution in the
        closed interval [`low`, `high`].  If `high` is None (the default),
        then results are from [1, `low`].
        Parameters
        ----------
        low : int
            Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
            ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is the *highest* such
            integer).
        high : int, optional
            If provided, the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from the
            distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : int or ndarray of ints
            `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
            distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.
        See Also
        --------
        random.randint : Similar to `random_integers`, only for the half-open
            interval [`low`, `high`), and 0 is the lowest value if `high` is
            omitted.
        Notes
        -----
        To sample from N evenly spaced floating-point numbers between a and b,
        use::
          a + (b - a) * (np.random.random_integers(N) - 1) / (N - 1.)
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.random_integers(5)
        4
        >>> type(np.random.random_integers(5))
        <type 'int'>
        >>> np.random.random_integers(5, size=(3.,2.))
        array([[5, 4],
               [3, 3],
               [4, 5]])
        Choose five random numbers from the set of five evenly-spaced
        numbers between 0 and 2.5, inclusive (*i.e.*, from the set
        :math:`{0, 5/8, 10/8, 15/8, 20/8}`):
        >>> 2.5 * (np.random.random_integers(5, size=(5,)) - 1) / 4.
        array([ 0.625,  1.25 ,  0.625,  0.625,  2.5  ])
        Roll two six sided dice 1000 times and sum the results:
        >>> d1 = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, 1000)
        >>> d2 = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, 1000)
        >>> dsums = d1 + d2
        Display results as a histogram:
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(dsums, 11, normed=True)
        >>> plt.show()
        
        randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)
        Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.
        If positive, int_like or int-convertible arguments are provided,
        `randn` generates an array of shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``, filled
        with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
        distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 (if any of the :math:`d_i` are
        floats, they are first converted to integers by truncation). A single
        float randomly sampled from the distribution is returned if no
        argument is provided.
        This is a convenience function.  If you want an interface that takes a
        tuple as the first argument, use `numpy.random.standard_normal` instead.
        Parameters
        ----------
        d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
            The dimensions of the returned array, should be all positive.
            If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        Z : ndarray or float
            A ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``-shaped array of floating-point samples from
            the standard normal distribution, or a single such float if
            no parameters were supplied.
        See Also
        --------
        random.standard_normal : Similar, but takes a tuple as its argument.
        Notes
        -----
        For random samples from :math:`N(\mu, \sigma^2)`, use:
        ``sigma * np.random.randn(...) + mu``
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randn()
        2.1923875335537315 #random

        >>> 2.5 * np.random.randn(2, 4) + 3
        array([[-4.49401501,  4.00950034, -1.81814867,  7.29718677],  #random
               [ 0.39924804,  4.68456316,  4.99394529,  4.84057254]]) #random
        
        rand(d0, d1, ..., dn)

        random samples from a uniform distribution
        over ``[0, 1)``.
        Parameters
        ----------
        d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
            The dimensions of the returned array, should all be positive.
            If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray, shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``
            Random values.
        See Also
        --------
        random
        Notes
        -----
        This is a convenience function. If you want an interface that
        takes a shape-tuple as the first argument, refer to
        np.random.random_sample .
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.rand(3,2)
        array([[ 0.14022471,  0.96360618],  #random
               [ 0.37601032,  0.25528411],  #random

        uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a uniform distribution.
        Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
        ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
        any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
        by `uniform`.
        Parameters
        ----------
        low : float, optional
            Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
        high : float
            Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Drawn samples, with shape `size`.
        See Also
        --------
        randint : Discrete uniform distribution, yielding integers.
        random_integers : Discrete uniform distribution over the closed
                          interval ``[low, high]``.
        random_sample : Floats uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        random : Alias for `random_sample`.
        rand : Convenience function that accepts dimensions as input, e.g.,
               ``rand(2,2)`` would generate a 2-by-2 array of floats,
               uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function of the uniform distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}
        anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.
        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)
        All values are within the given interval:
        >>> np.all(s >= -1)
        True
        >>> np.all(s < 0)
        True
        Display the histogram of the samples, along with the
        probability density function:
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 15, normed=True)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, np.ones_like(bins), linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()
        
        choice(a, size=None, replace=True, p=None)

        a : 1-D array-like or int
            If an ndarray, a random sample is generated from its elements.
            If an int, the random sample is generated as if a was np.arange(n)
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        replace : boolean, optional
            Whether the sample is with or without replacement
        p : 1-D array-like, optional

        --------
        samples : 1-D ndarray, shape (size,)
            The generated random samples
        Raises
        -------
        ValueError
            If a is an int and less than zero, if a or p are not 1-dimensional,
            if a is an array-like of size 0, if p is not a vector of
            probabilities, if a and p have different lengths, or if
            replace=False and the sample size is greater than the population
            size
        See Also
        ---------
        randint, shuffle, permutation
        Examples
        ---------
        Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3)
        array([0, 3, 4])
        >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.randint(0,5,3)
        Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
        array([3, 3, 0])
        Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
        replacement:

        array([3,1,0])
        >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.permutation(np.arange(5))[:3]
        Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size
        3 without replacement:
        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
        array([2, 3, 0])
        Any of the above can be repeated with an arbitrary array-like
        instead of just integers. For instance:
        >>> aa_milne_arr = ['pooh', 'rabbit', 'piglet', 'Christopher']
        >>> np.random.choice(aa_milne_arr, 5, p=[0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3])
        array(['pooh', 'pooh', 'pooh', 'Christopher', 'piglet'],

        Returns
        -------
        out : str
            String of length `length`.
        Examples

        >>> np.random.bytes(10)
        ' eh\x85\x022SZ\xbf\xa4' #random
        
        randint(low, high=None, size=None)
        Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).
        Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution in the
        "half-open" interval [`low`, `high`). If `high` is None (the default),
        then results are from [0, `low`).
        Parameters
        ----------
        low : int
            Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
            ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is the *highest* such
            integer).
        high : int, optional
            If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
            from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : int or ndarray of ints
            `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
            distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.
        See Also
        --------
        random.random_integers : similar to `randint`, only for the closed
            interval [`low`, `high`], and 1 is the lowest value if `high` is
            omitted. In particular, this other one is the one to use to generate
            uniformly distributed discrete non-integers.
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randint(2, size=10)

        array([[4, 0, 2, 1],
               [3, 2, 2, 0]])
        
        tomaxint(size=None)
        Random integers between 0 and ``sys.maxint``, inclusive.
        Return a sample of uniformly distributed random integers in the interval
        [0, ``sys.maxint``].
        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Drawn samples, with shape `size`.

        >>> sys.maxint
        2147483647
        >>> RS.tomaxint((2,2,2)) < sys.maxint
        array([[[ True,  True],
                [ True,  True]],
               [[ True,  True],
                [ True,  True]]], dtype=bool)
        
        random_sample(size=None)
        Return random floats in the half-open interval [0.0, 1.0).
        Results are from the "continuous uniform" distribution over the
        stated interval.  To sample :math:`Unif[a, b), b > a` multiply
        the output of `random_sample` by `(b-a)` and add `a`::
          (b - a) * random_sample() + a
        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : float or ndarray of floats
            Array of random floats of shape `size` (unless ``size=None``, in which
            case a single float is returned).
        Examples
        --------

        Three-by-two array of random numbers from [-5, 0):
        >>> 5 * np.random.random_sample((3, 2)) - 5
        array([[-3.99149989, -0.52338984],

               [-1.23204345, -1.75224494]])
        
        set_state(state)
        Set the internal state of the generator from a tuple.
        For use if one has reason to manually (re-)set the internal state of the
        "Mersenne Twister"[1]_ pseudo-random number generating algorithm.
        Parameters
        ----------
        state : tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float)
            The `state` tuple has the following items:
            1. the string 'MT19937', specifying the Mersenne Twister algorithm.
            2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integers ``keys``.
            3. an integer ``pos``.
            4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
            5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.
        Returns
        -------
        out : None
            Returns 'None' on success.

        --------
        get_state
        Notes
        -----
        `set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the
        random distributions in NumPy. If the internal state is manually altered,
        the user should know exactly what he/she is doing.
        For backwards compatibility, the form (str, array of 624 uints, int) is
        also accepted although it is missing some information about the cached
        Gaussian value: ``state = ('MT19937', keys, pos)``.

        zipf(a, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Zipf distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Zipf distribution with specified parameter
        `a` > 1.
        The Zipf distribution (also known as the zeta distribution) is a
        continuous probability distribution that satisfies Zipf's law: the
        frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank in a
        frequency table.
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float > 1
            Distribution parameter.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : scalar or ndarray
            The returned samples are greater than or equal to one.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Zipf distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{x^{-a}}{\zeta(a)},
        where :math:`\zeta` is the Riemann Zeta function.
        It is named for the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who noted
        that the frequency of any word in a sample of a language is inversely
        proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> a = 2. # parameter
        >>> s = np.random.zipf(a, 1000)

        >>> plt.show()
        
        weibull(a, size=None)
        Weibull distribution.
        Draw samples from a 1-parameter Weibull distribution with the given
        shape parameter `a`.
        .. math:: X = (-ln(U))^{1/a}
        Here, U is drawn from the uniform distribution over (0,1].
        The more common 2-parameter Weibull, including a scale parameter
        :math:`\lambda` is just :math:`X = \lambda(-ln(U))^{1/a}`.
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float
            Shape of the distribution.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Notes
        -----
        The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution for smallest
        values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler distribution) is one of a class of
        Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme
        value problems.  This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.
        The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
                         {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},
        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
        The function has its peak (the mode) at
        :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
        When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
        distribution.

        vonmises(mu, kappa, size=None)
        Draw samples from a von Mises distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a von Mises distribution with specified mode
        (mu) and dispersion (kappa), on the interval [-pi, pi].
        The von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal
        distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the unit
        circle.  It may be thought of as the circular analogue of the normal
        distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mu : float
            Mode ("center") of the distribution.
        kappa : float
            Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : scalar or ndarray
            The returned samples, which are in the interval [-pi, pi].
        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.distributions.vonmises : probability density function,
            distribution, or cumulative density function, etc.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the von Mises distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},
        where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
        and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.
        The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
        Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
        States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
        probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of
        science.

        uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a uniform distribution.
        Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
        ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
        any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
        by `uniform`.
        Parameters
        ----------
        low : float, optional
            Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
        high : float
            Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Drawn samples, with shape `size`.
        See Also
        --------
        randint : Discrete uniform distribution, yielding integers.
        random_integers : Discrete uniform distribution over the closed
                          interval ``[low, high]``.
        random_sample : Floats uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        random : Alias for `random_sample`.
        rand : Convenience function that accepts dimensions as input, e.g.,
               ``rand(2,2)`` would generate a 2-by-2 array of floats,
               uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function of the uniform distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}
        anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.
        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)
        All values are within the given interval:
        >>> np.all(s >= -1)
        True
        >>> np.all(s < 0)
        True
        Display the histogram of the samples, along with the
        probability density function:
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 15, normed=True)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, np.ones_like(bins), linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()
        
        triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)
        Draw samples from the triangular distribution.
        The triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with
        lower limit left, peak at mode, and upper limit right. Unlike the other
        distributions, these parameters directly define the shape of the pdf.
        Parameters
        ----------
        left : scalar
            Lower limit.
        mode : scalar
            The value where the peak of the distribution occurs.
            The value should fulfill the condition ``left <= mode <= right``.
        right : scalar
            Upper limit, should be larger than `left`.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            The returned samples all lie in the interval [left, right].
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Triangular distribution is
        .. math:: P(x;l, m, r) = \begin{cases}
                  \frac{2(x-l)}{(r-l)(m-l)}& \text{for $l \leq x \leq m$},\\
                  \frac{2(m-x)}{(r-l)(r-m)}& \text{for $m \leq x \leq r$},\\
                  0& \text{otherwise}.
                  \end{cases}
        The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined problems where the
        underlying distribution is not known, but some knowledge of the limits and
        mode exists. Often it is used in simulations.

        array([[[ True,  True],
                [ True,  True]],

        standard_t(df, size=None)
        Standard Student's t distribution with df degrees of freedom.
        A special case of the hyperbolic distribution.
        As `df` gets large, the result resembles that of the standard normal
        distribution (`standard_normal`).
        Parameters
        ----------
        df : int
            Degrees of freedom, should be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the t distribution is
        .. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
                  \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}
        The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a Normal
        distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether the sample mean
        (that is the mean calculated from the data) is a good estimate of the true
        mean.
        The derivation of the t-distribution was forst published in 1908 by William
        Gisset while working for the Guinness Brewery in Dublin. Due to proprietary
        issues, he had to publish under a pseudonym, and so he used the name
        Student.

        Examples
        --------
        From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
        women in Kj is:
        >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
        ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])
        Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
        value of 7725 kJ?
        We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the
        recommended value?
        >>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=100000)
        >>> np.mean(intake)
        6753.636363636364
        >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
        1142.1232221373727
        Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
        value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of
        freedom, N-1.
        >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, normed=True)
        For a one-sided t-test, how far out in the distribution does the t
        statistic appear?
        >>> >>> np.sum(s<t) / float(len(s))
        0.0090699999999999999  #random
        So the p-value is about 0.009, which says the null hypothesis has a
        probability of about 99% of being true.
        
        standard_normal(size=None)
        Returns samples from a Standard Normal distribution (mean=0, stdev=1).
        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : float or ndarray
            Drawn samples.
        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = np.random.standard_normal(8000)
        >>> s
        array([ 0.6888893 ,  0.78096262, -0.89086505, ...,  0.49876311, #random
               -0.38672696, -0.4685006 ])                               #random
        >>> s.shape
        (8000,)
        >>> s = np.random.standard_normal(size=(3, 4, 2))
        >>> s.shape
        (3, 4, 2)
        
        standard_cauchy(size=None)
        Standard Cauchy distribution with mode = 0.
        Also known as the Lorentz distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            The drawn samples.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is
        .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
                  (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }
        and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
        :math:`\gamma=1`
        The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
        oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
        also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
        a random angle will cut the x axis.
        When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
        tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
        their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
        very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

        rayleigh(scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Rayleigh distribution.
        The :math:`\chi` and Weibull distributions are generalizations of the
        Rayleigh.
        Parameters
        ----------
        scale : scalar
            Scale, also equals the mode. Should be >= 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Notes

        The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is
        .. math:: P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}
        The Rayleigh distribution arises if the wind speed and wind direction are
        both gaussian variables, then the vector wind velocity forms a Rayleigh
        distribution. The Rayleigh distribution is used to model the expected
        output from wind turbines.

            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------

        -----
        The probability density function is

        The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
        distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
        distribution.

        claims.

        pareto(a, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with specified shape.
        The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto distribution. The
        classical Pareto distribution can be obtained from the Lomax distribution
        by adding 1 and multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).
        The smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard Pareto
        distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also be considered as a
        simplified version of the Generalized Pareto distribution (available in
        SciPy), with the scale set to one and the location set to zero.
        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is unbounded above.
        It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In this distribution, 80 percent of
        the weights are in the lowest 20 percent of the range, while the other 20
        percent fill the remaining 80 percent of the range.
        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : float, > 0.
            Shape of the distribution.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Pareto distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}
        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.
        The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto,
        is a power law probability distribution useful in many real world problems.
        Outside the field of economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe the
        distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found use in insurance,

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> a, m = 3., 2.  # shape and mode
        >>> s = (np.random.pareto(a, 1000) + 1) * m
        Display the histogram of the samples, along with the probability
        density function:
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, _ = plt.hist(s, 100, normed=True)
        >>> fit = a*m**a / bins**(a+1)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, max(count)*fit/max(fit), linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()
        
        normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
        The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
        derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
        independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
        its characteristic shape (see the example below).
        The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
        describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
        by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
        unique distribution [2]_.
        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
            Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
        scale : float
            Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

            distribution or cumulative density function, etc.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
                         e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },
        where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard deviation.
        The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`, is called the
        variance.
        The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
        the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
        :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
        `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to the
        mean, rather than those far away.

        >>> plt.show()
        
        noncentral_f(dfnum, dfden, nonc, size=None)
        Draw samples from the noncentral F distribution.
        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
        freedom in denominator), where both parameters > 1.
        `nonc` is the non-centrality parameter.
        Parameters
        ----------
        dfnum : int
            Parameter, should be > 1.
        dfden : int
            Parameter, should be > 1.
        nonc : float
            Parameter, should be >= 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : scalar or ndarray
            Drawn samples.
        Notes
        -----
        When calculating the power of an experiment (power = probability of
        rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative is true) the
        non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is
        true, the F statistic follows a central F distribution. When the null
        hypothesis is not true, then it follows a non-central F statistic.

        In a study, testing for a specific alternative to the null hypothesis
        requires use of the Noncentral F distribution. We need to calculate the
        area in the tail of the distribution that exceeds the value of the F
        distribution for the null hypothesis.  We'll plot the two probability
        distributions for comparison.

        noncentral_chisquare(df, nonc, size=None)
        Draw samples from a noncentral chi-square distribution.
        The noncentral :math:`\chi^2` distribution is a generalisation of
        the :math:`\chi^2` distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        df : int
            Degrees of freedom, should be >= 1.
        nonc : float
            Non-centrality, should be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the noncentral Chi-square distribution
        is
        .. math:: P(x;df,nonc) = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}
                               \frac{e^{-nonc/2}(nonc/2)^{i}}{i!}P_{Y_{df+2i}}(x),
        where :math:`Y_{q}` is the Chi-square with q degrees of freedom.
        In Delhi (2007), it is noted that the noncentral chi-square is useful in
        bombing and coverage problems, the probability of killing the point target
        given by the noncentral chi-squared distribution.

        negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)
        Draw samples from a negative_binomial distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a negative_Binomial distribution with specified
        parameters, `n` trials and `p` probability of success where `n` is an
        integer > 0 and `p` is in the interval [0, 1].
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Parameter, > 0.
        p : float
            Parameter, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : int or ndarray of ints
            Drawn samples.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Negative Binomial distribution is
        .. math:: P(N;n,p) = \binom{N+n-1}{n-1}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},
        where :math:`n-1` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the probability
        of success, and :math:`N+n-1` is the number of trials.
        The negative binomial distribution gives the probability of n-1 successes
        and N failures in N+n-1 trials, and success on the (N+n)th trial.
        If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears, then the
        probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that appear before the
        third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

        Draw samples from the distribution:
        A real world example. A company drills wild-cat oil exploration wells, each
        with an estimated probability of success of 0.1.  What is the probability
        of having one success for each successive well, that is what is the

        ...    print i, "wells drilled, probability of one success =", probability
        
        multivariate_normal(mean, cov[, size])
        Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
        The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
        generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
        dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
        covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
        (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
        squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
            Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
        cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
            Covariance matrix of the distribution.  Must be symmetric and
            positive-semidefinite for "physically meaningful" results.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
            generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
            each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
            If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
            the shape is ``(N,)``.
            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
            value drawn from the distribution.
        Notes
        -----
        The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
        location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
        analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
        univariate normal distribution.
        Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
        From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
        samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
        element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
        The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
        "spread").
        Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
        approximations include:
          - Spherical covariance (*cov* is a multiple of the identity matrix)
          - Diagonal covariance (*cov* has non-negative elements, and only on
            the diagonal)
        This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
        generated data-points:
        >>> mean = [0,0]
        >>> cov = [[1,0],[0,100]] # diagonal covariance, points lie on x or y-axis
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> x,y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,5000).T
        >>> plt.plot(x,y,'x'); plt.axis('equal'); plt.show()
        Note that the covariance matrix must be non-negative definite.

        The following is probably true, given that 0.6 is roughly twice the
        standard deviation:
        >>> print list( (x[0,0,:] - mean) < 0.6 )
        [True, True]
        
        multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)
        Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
        The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the
        binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
        possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
        where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
        distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
        ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome
        was ``i``.
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Number of experiments.
        pvals : sequence of floats, length p
            Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
            should sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
            account for the remaining probability, as long as
            ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
        size : tuple of ints
            Given a `size` of ``(M, N, K)``, then ``M*N*K`` samples are drawn,
            and the output shape becomes ``(M, N, K, p)``, since each sample
            has shape ``(p,)``.
        Examples
        --------
        Throw a dice 20 times:
        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
        array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])
        It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
        Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
        array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3],
               [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])
        For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
        we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
        A loaded dice is more likely to land on number 6:
        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5)
        array([13, 16, 13, 16, 42])
        
        logseries(p, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Logarithmic Series distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Log Series distribution with specified
        parameter, p (probability, 0 < p < 1).
        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
        scale : float > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : {ndarray, scalar}
                  where the values are all integers in  [0, n].

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Log Series distribution is
        .. math:: P(k) = \frac{-p^k}{k \ln(1-p)},
        where p = probability.
        The Log Series distribution is frequently used to represent species
        richness and occurrence, first proposed by Fisher, Corbet, and
        Williams in 1943 [2].  It may also be used to model the numbers of
        occupants seen in cars [3].

        lognormal(mean=0.0, sigma=1.0, size=None)
        Return samples drawn from a log-normal distribution.
        Draw samples from a log-normal distribution with specified mean,
        standard deviation, and array shape.  Note that the mean and standard
        deviation are not the values for the distribution itself, but of the
        underlying normal distribution it is derived from.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : float
            Mean value of the underlying normal distribution
        sigma : float, > 0.
            Standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or float
            The desired samples. An array of the same shape as `size` if given,
            if `size` is None a float is returned.

        Notes
        -----
        A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
        distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
        distribution is:
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                         e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
        where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
        deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
        A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
        of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
        the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
        *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
        variables.

        logistic(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Logistic distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Logistic distribution with specified
        parameters, loc (location or mean, also median), and scale (>0).
        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
        scale : float > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : {ndarray, scalar}
                  where the values are all integers in  [0, n].

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Logistic distribution is
        .. math:: P(x) = P(x) = \frac{e^{-(x-\mu)/s}}{s(1+e^{-(x-\mu)/s})^2},
        where :math:`\mu` = location and :math:`s` = scale.
        The Logistic distribution is used in Extreme Value problems where it
        can act as a mixture of Gumbel distributions, in Epidemiology, and by
        the World Chess Federation (FIDE) where it is used in the Elo ranking
        system, assuming the performance of each player is a logistically
        distributed random variable.

        hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsample, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Hypergeometric distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Hypergeometric distribution with specified
        parameters, ngood (ways to make a good selection), nbad (ways to make
        a bad selection), and nsample = number of items sampled, which is less
        than or equal to the sum ngood + nbad.
        Parameters
        ----------
        ngood : int or array_like
            Number of ways to make a good selection.  Must be nonnegative.
        nbad : int or array_like
            Number of ways to make a bad selection.  Must be nonnegative.
        nsample : int or array_like
            Number of items sampled.  Must be at least 1 and at most
            ``ngood + nbad``.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            The values are all integers in  [0, n].
        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.distributions.hypergeom : probability density function,
            distribution or cumulative density function, etc.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
        .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{m}{n}\binom{N-m}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}},
        where :math:`0 \le x \le m` and :math:`n+m-N \le x \le n`
        for P(x) the probability of x successes, n = ngood, m = nbad, and
        N = number of samples.
        Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, ngood of them
        black and nbad are white. If you draw nsample balls without
        replacement, then the Hypergeometric distribution describes the
        distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
        Note that this distribution is very similar to the Binomial
        distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
        replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
        replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
        becomes large, this distribution approaches the Binomial.

        Notes
        -----
        The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme Value
        Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)
        distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.  The Gumbel is a
        special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution for maximums from
        distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
        The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
                  \beta}},
        where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and :math:`\beta` is
        the scale parameter.
        The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
        very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
        flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and rainfall
        rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of an event in
        the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a Gaussian, hence
        the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year floods. Floods were
        initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which underestimated the frequency
        of extreme events.
        It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
        Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
        Frechet.
        The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance of
        :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

        geometric(p, size=None)
        Draw samples from the geometric distribution.
        Bernoulli trials are experiments with one of two outcomes:
        success or failure (an example of such an experiment is flipping
        a coin).  The geometric distribution models the number of trials
        that must be run in order to achieve success.  It is therefore
        supported on the positive integers, ``k = 1, 2, ...``.
        The probability mass function of the geometric distribution is
        .. math:: f(k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p
        where `p` is the probability of success of an individual trial.
        Parameters
        ----------
        p : float
            The probability of success of an individual trial.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Samples from the geometric distribution, shaped according to
            `size`.
        Examples
        --------
        Draw ten thousand values from the geometric distribution,
        with the probability of an individual success equal to 0.35:
        >>> z = np.random.geometric(p=0.35, size=10000)
        How many trials succeeded after a single run?
        >>> (z == 1).sum() / 10000.

        gamma(shape, scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Gamma distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
        `shape` (sometimes designated "k") and `scale` (sometimes designated
        "theta"), where both parameters are > 0.
        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : scalar > 0
            The shape of the gamma distribution.
        scale : scalar > 0, optional
            The scale of the gamma distribution.  Default is equal to 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray, float
            Returns one sample unless `size` parameter is specified.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},
        where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
        and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
        The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
        electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
        waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

        ...                      (sps.gamma(shape)*scale**shape))

        >>> plt.show()
        
        f(dfnum, dfden, size=None)
        Draw samples from a F distribution.
        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of freedom
        in denominator), where both parameters should be greater than zero.
        The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
        Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
        that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
        variates.
        Parameters
        ----------
        dfnum : float
            Degrees of freedom in numerator. Should be greater than zero.
        dfden : float
            Degrees of freedom in denominator. Should be greater than zero.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : {ndarray, scalar}
            Samples from the Fisher distribution.

            distribution or cumulative density function, etc.
        Notes
        -----
        The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
        variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
        so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
        problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
        between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
        degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
        minus the number of groups.

        Examples
        --------
        An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40.
        Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
        without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
        case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
        82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
        data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
        status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
        Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
        >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
        >>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)
        The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :
        >>> sort(s)[-10]
        7.61988120985
        So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
        the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
        level.

        Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3)
        array([0, 3, 4])
        >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.randint(0,5,3)
        Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
        array([3, 3, 0])
        Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
        replacement:
        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False)
        array([3,1,0])
        >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.permutation(np.arange(5))[:3]
        Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size

        chisquare(df, size=None)
        Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.
        When `df` independent random variables, each with standard normal
        distributions (mean 0, variance 1), are squared and summed, the
        resulting distribution is chi-square (see Notes).  This distribution
        is often used in hypothesis testing.
        Parameters
        ----------
        df : int
             Number of degrees of freedom.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a

        Returns
        -------
        output : ndarray

            array.
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            When `df` <= 0 or when an inappropriate `size` (e.g. ``size=-1``)
            is given.
        Notes
        -----
        The variable obtained by summing the squares of `df` independent,
        standard normally distributed random variables:
        .. math:: Q = \sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{df}} X^2_i
        is chi-square distributed, denoted
        .. math:: Q \sim \chi^2_k.
        The probability density function of the chi-squared distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{(1/2)^{k/2}}{\Gamma(k/2)}
                         x^{k/2 - 1} e^{-x/2},
        where :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function,
        .. math:: \Gamma(x) = \int_0^{-\infty} t^{x - 1} e^{-t} dt.

        binomial(n, p, size=None)
        Draw samples from a binomial distribution.
        Samples are drawn from a Binomial distribution with specified
        parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
        n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
        input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : float (but truncated to an integer)
                parameter, >= 0.
        p : float
                parameter, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : {ndarray, scalar}
                  where the values are all integers in  [0, n].

        --------
        scipy.stats.distributions.binom : probability density function,
            distribution or cumulative density function, etc.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Binomial distribution is
        .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
        where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
        of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
        When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
        using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
        product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
        number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
        instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
        handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
        so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

        wald(mean, scale, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Wald, or Inverse Gaussian, distribution.
        As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
        Gaussian.
        Some references claim that the Wald is an Inverse Gaussian with mean=1, but
        this is by no means universal.
        The Inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name Inverse Gaussian
        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a unit
        distance and distance covered in unit time.
        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : scalar
            Distribution mean, should be > 0.
        scale : scalar
            Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn sample, all greater than zero.
        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                    \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
        As noted above the Inverse Gaussian distribution first arise from attempts
        to model Brownian Motion. It is also a competitor to the Weibull for use in
        reliability modeling and modeling stock returns and interest rate
        processes.

        Parameters
        ----------

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
        .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},
        where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
        and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
        The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
        electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
        waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

        the output of `random_sample` by `(b-a)` and add `a`::
          (b - a) * random_sample() + a
        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : float or ndarray of floats
            Array of random floats of shape `size` (unless ``size=None``, in which
            case a single float is returned).
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.random_sample()
        0.47108547995356098
        >>> type(np.random.random_sample())
        <type 'float'>
        >>> np.random.random_sample((5,))
        array([ 0.30220482,  0.86820401,  0.1654503 ,  0.11659149,  0.54323428])
        Three-by-two array of random numbers from [-5, 0):
        >>> 5 * np.random.random_sample((3, 2)) - 5
        array([[-3.99149989, -0.52338984],
               [-2.99091858, -0.79479508],
               [-1.23204345, -1.75224494]])
        
        randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)
        Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.
        If positive, int_like or int-convertible arguments are provided,
        `randn` generates an array of shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``, filled
        with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
        distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 (if any of the :math:`d_i` are
        floats, they are first converted to integers by truncation). A single
        float randomly sampled from the distribution is returned if no
        argument is provided.
        This is a convenience function.  If you want an interface that takes a
        tuple as the first argument, use `numpy.random.standard_normal` instead.
        Parameters
        ----------
        d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
            The dimensions of the returned array, should be all positive.
            If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        Z : ndarray or float
            A ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``-shaped array of floating-point samples from
            the standard normal distribution, or a single such float if
            no parameters were supplied.
        See Also
        --------
        random.standard_normal : Similar, but takes a tuple as its argument.
        Notes
        -----
        For random samples from :math:`N(\mu, \sigma^2)`, use:
        ``sigma * np.random.randn(...) + mu``
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randn()
        2.1923875335537315 #random
        Two-by-four array of samples from N(3, 6.25):
        >>> 2.5 * np.random.randn(2, 4) + 3
        array([[-4.49401501,  4.00950034, -1.81814867,  7.29718677],  #random
               [ 0.39924804,  4.68456316,  4.99394529,  4.84057254]]) #random
        
        rand(d0, d1, ..., dn)
        Random values in a given shape.
        Create an array of the given shape and propagate it with
        random samples from a uniform distribution
        over ``[0, 1)``.
        Parameters
        ----------
        d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
            The dimensions of the returned array, should all be positive.
            If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray, shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``
            Random values.
        See Also
        --------
        random
        Notes
        -----
        This is a convenience function. If you want an interface that
        takes a shape-tuple as the first argument, refer to
        np.random.random_sample .
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.rand(3,2)
        array([[ 0.14022471,  0.96360618],  #random
               [ 0.37601032,  0.25528411],  #random
               [ 0.49313049,  0.94909878]]) #random
        
        poisson(lam=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from a Poisson distribution.
        The Poisson distribution is the limit of the Binomial
        distribution for large N.
        Parameters
        ----------
        lam : float or sequence of float
            Expectation of interval, should be >= 0. A sequence of expectation
            intervals must be broadcastable over the requested size.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Notes
        -----
        The Poisson distribution
        .. math:: f(k; \lambda)=\frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
        For events with an expected separation :math:`\lambda` the Poisson
        distribution :math:`f(k; \lambda)` describes the probability of
        :math:`k` events occurring within the observed interval :math:`\lambda`.
        Because the output is limited to the range of the C long type, a
        ValueError is raised when `lam` is within 10 sigma of the maximum
        representable value.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> s = np.random.poisson(5, 10000)
        Display histogram of the sample:
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 14, normed=True)
        >>> plt.show()
        Draw each 100 values for lambda 100 and 500:
        >>> s = np.random.poisson(lam=(100., 500.), size=(100, 2))
        
        permutation(x)
        Randomly permute a sequence, or return a permuted range.
        If `x` is a multi-dimensional array, it is only shuffled along its
        first index.
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : int or array_like
            If `x` is an integer, randomly permute ``np.arange(x)``.
            If `x` is an array, make a copy and shuffle the elements
            randomly.
        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            Permuted sequence or array range.
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.permutation(10)
        array([1, 7, 4, 3, 0, 9, 2, 5, 8, 6])
        >>> np.random.permutation([1, 4, 9, 12, 15])
        array([15,  1,  9,  4, 12])
        >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
        >>> np.random.permutation(arr)
        array([[6, 7, 8],
               [0, 1, 2],
               [3, 4, 5]])
        
        laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
        Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
        specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).
        The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
        but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
        difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
        random variables.
        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float
            The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak.
        scale : float
            :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        Notes
        -----
        It has the probability density function
        .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
                                       \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).
        The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency of an error
        can be expressed as an exponential function of the absolute magnitude of
        the error, which leads to the Laplace distribution. For many problems in
        Economics and Health sciences, this distribution seems to model the data
        better than the standard Gaussian distribution

        dirichlet(alpha, size=None)
        Draw samples from the Dirichlet distribution.
        Draw `size` samples of dimension k from a Dirichlet distribution. A
        Dirichlet-distributed random variable can be seen as a multivariate
        generalization of a Beta distribution. Dirichlet pdf is the conjugate
        prior of a multinomial in Bayesian inference.
        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : array
            Parameter of the distribution (k dimension for sample of
            dimension k).
        size : array
            Number of samples to draw.
        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray,
            The drawn samples, of shape (alpha.ndim, size).
        Notes
        -----
        .. math:: X \approx \prod_{i=1}^{k}{x^{\alpha_i-1}_i}
        Uses the following property for computation: for each dimension,
        draw a random sample y_i from a standard gamma generator of shape
        `alpha_i`, then
        :math:`X = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^k{y_i}} (y_1, \ldots, y_n)` is
        Dirichlet distributed.

        Taking an example cited in Wikipedia, this distribution can be used if
        one wanted to cut strings (each of initial length 1.0) into K pieces
        with different lengths, where each piece had, on average, a designated
        average length, but allowing some variation in the relative sizes of the
        pieces.
