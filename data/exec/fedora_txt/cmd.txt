This command is used to add a comment for the specified service.  If you work with other administrators, you may find it useful to share information about a host
or service that is having problems if more than one of you may be working on it.  If you do not check the 'persistent' option, the comment will automatically be
deleted the next time Nagios is restarted.
This command is used to delete a specific host comment.
This command is used to delete a specific service comment.
This command is used to delay the next problem notification that is sent out for the specified host.  The notification delay will be disregarded if
the host changes state before the next notification is scheduled to be sent out.  This command has no effect if the host is currently UP.
This command is used to delay the next problem notification that is sent out for the specified service.  The notification delay will be disregarded if
the service changes state before the next notification is scheduled to be sent out.  This command has no effect if the service is currently in an OK state.
This command is used to schedule the next check of a particular service.  Nagios will re-queue the service to be checked at the time you specify.
If you select the <i>force check</i> option, Nagios will force a check of the service regardless of both what time the scheduled check occurs and whether or not checks are enabled for the service.
This command is used to enable active checks of a service.
This command is used to disable active checks of a service.
This command is used to disable host and service notifications on a program-wide basis.

This command is used to shutdown the Nagios process. Note: Once the Nagios has been shutdown, it cannot be restarted via the web interface!
This command is used to restart the Nagios process.   Executing a restart command is equivalent to sending the process a HUP signal.
All information will be flushed from memory, the configuration files will be re-read, and Nagios will start monitoring with the new configuration information.
This command is used to enable active checks of all services associated with the specified host.  This <i>does not</i> enable checks of the host unless you check the 'Enable for host too' option.
This command is used to disable active checks of all services associated with the specified host.  When a service is disabled Nagios will not monitor the service.  Doing this will prevent any notifications being sent out for
the specified service while it is disabled.  In order to have Nagios check the service in the future you will have to re-enable the service.
Note that disabling service checks may not necessarily prevent notifications from being sent out about the host which those services are associated with.  This <i>does not</i> disable checks of the host unless you check the 'Disable for host too' option.
This command is used to scheduled the next check of all services on the specified host.

This command is used to acknowledge a host problem.  When a host problem is acknowledged, future notifications about problems are temporarily disabled until the host changes from its current state.
If you want acknowledgement to disable notifications until the host recovers, check the 'Sticky Acknowledgement' checkbox.
Contacts for this host will receive a notification about the acknowledgement, so they are aware that someone is working on the problem.  Additionally, a comment will also be added to the host.
Make sure to enter your name and fill in a brief description of what you are doing in the comment field.  If you would like the host comment to remain once the acknowledgement is removed, check
the 'Persistent Comment' checkbox.  If you do not want an acknowledgement notification sent out to the appropriate contacts, uncheck the 'Send Notification' checkbox.

This command is used to submit a passive check result for a particular service.  It is particularly useful for resetting security-related services to OK states once they have been dealt with.
This command is used to submit a passive check result for a particular host.
This command is used to schedule downtime for a particular host.  During the specified downtime, Nagios will not send notifications out about the host.
When the scheduled downtime expires, Nagios will send out notifications for this host as it normally would.  Scheduled downtimes are preserved
across program shutdowns and restarts.  Both the start and end times should be specified in the following format:  <b>mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss</b>.
If you select the <i>fixed</i> option, the downtime will be in effect between the start and end times you specify.  If you do not select the <i>fixed</i>
option, Nagios will treat this as "flexible" downtime.  Flexible downtime starts when the host goes down or becomes unreachable (sometime between the
start and end times you specified) and lasts as long as the duration of time you enter.  The duration fields do not apply for fixed downtime.
This command is used to schedule downtime for all services on a particular host.  During the specified downtime, Nagios will not send notifications out about the host.

This command is used to send a custom notification about the specified %s.  Useful in emergencies when you need to notify admins of an issue regarding a monitored system or service.
Custom notifications normally follow the regular notification logic in Nagios.  Selecting the <i>Forced</i> option will force the notification to be sent out, regardless of the time restrictions, whether or not notifications are enabled, etc.  Selecting the <i>Broadcast</i> option causes the notification to be sent out to all normal (non-escalated) and escalated contacts.  These options allow you to override the normal notification logic if you need to get an important message out.

I'm guessing you're trying to execute the CGI from a command line.
In order to do that, you need to set the REQUEST_METHOD environment
variable to either "GET", "HEAD", or "POST".  When using the
GET and HEAD methods, arguments can be passed to the CGI
by setting the "QUERY_STRING" environment variable.  If you're
using the POST method, data is read from standard input.  Also of
note: if you've enabled authentication in the CGIs, you must set the
"REMOTE_USER" environment variable to be the name of the user you're

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR='RED'>Error: Could not open CGI config file '%s' for reading!</FONT></STRONG></P>
Here are some things you should check in order to resolve this error:
<LI>Make sure you've installed a CGI config file in its proper location.  See the error message about for details on where the CGI is expecting to find the configuration file.  A sample CGI configuration file (named <b>cgi.cfg</b>) can be found in the <b>sample-config/</b> subdirectory of the Nagios source code distribution.
<LI>Make sure the user your web server is running as has permission to read the CGI config file.
Make sure you read the documentation on installing and configuring Nagios thoroughly before continuing.  If all else fails, try sending a message to one of the mailing lists.  More information can be found at <a href='http://www.nagios.org'>http://www.nagios.org</a>.

<LI>Make sure you've installed a main config file in its proper location.  See the error message about for details on where the CGI is expecting to find the configuration file.  A sample main configuration file (named <b>nagios.cfg</b>) can be found in the <b>sample-config/</b> subdirectory of the Nagios source code distribution.
<LI>Make sure the user your web server is running as has permission to read the main config file.
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR='RED'>Error: Could not read object configuration data!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<LI>Verify configuration options using the <b>-v</b> command-line option to check for errors.
<LI>Check the Nagios log file for messages relating to startup or status data errors.
Make sure you read the documentation on installing, configuring and running Nagios thoroughly before continuing.  If all else fails, try sending a message to one of the mailing lists.  More information can be found at <a href='http://www.nagios.org'>http://www.nagios.org</a>.
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR='RED'>Error: Could not read host and service status information!</FONT></STRONG></P>
The most common cause of this error message (especially for new users), is the fact that Nagios is not actually running.  If Nagios is indeed not running, this is a normal error message.  It simply indicates that the CGIs could not obtain the current status of hosts and services that are being monitored.  If you've just installed things, make sure you read the documentation on starting Nagios.
Some other things you should check in order to resolve this error include:
<LI>Always verify configuration options using the <b>-v</b> command-line option before starting or restarting Nagios!
