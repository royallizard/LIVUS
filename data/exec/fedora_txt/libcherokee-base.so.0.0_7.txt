Could not parse header from the back-end
It looks like the back-end server sent a malformed HTTP response.
Dump of the header buffer (len=%d): %s
Failed to set nonblocking (fd=%d): ${errno}
The issue seems to be related to your system.
Could not find the rrdtool binary.
A custom rrdtool binary has not been defined, and the server could not find one in the $PATH.
execv failed cmd='%s': ${errno}
Insufficient permissions to work with the RRD directory: %s
Cannot create the '%s' directory
Taking source='%s' back on-line: %d active.
The server is re-enabling one of the Information Sources.
Taking source='%s' off-line. Active %d.
The server is disabling one of the Information Sources.
Sources exhausted: re-enabling one.
All the information sources are disabled at this moment. Cherokee needs to re-enable at least one.
Taking source='%s' back on-line.
Taking all sources back on-line.
All the Information Sources have been off-lined. The server is re-enabling all of them in order to start over again.
Timed out while resolving '%s'
For some reason, Cherokee could not resolve the hostname.
Could not read 'user' value for '%s'
The configuration file seems to be broken.
Could not read 'password' value for '%s'
Empty authlist: Access will be denied.
The access to this resource will be denied as long as the list of allowed users is empty.
Cherokee could not configure PAM propertly. Most likely you have found an incompatibility issue between Cherokee and your system PAM library.
User '%s' - not authenticated: %s
Most likely the password did not match
User '%s' - invalid account: %s
The specified user does not exist on the sytem.
Validator LDAP: Unknown key: '%s'
The LDAP validation module requires a '%s' property
It looks like you did not fill a required property. Check the LDAP details and try again.
Security problem found in LDAP validation config
LDAP validator: Potential security problem found: anonymous bind validation. Check (RFC 2251, section 4.2.2)
Could not connect to LDAP: %s:%d: '${errno}'
Could not set the LDAP version 3: %s
cannot StartTLS, it is not supported by LDAP client libraries
Could not bind (%s:%d): %s:%s : %s
Could not search in LDAP server: %s
File based validators need a password file
This validation modules reads a local file in order to get the authorizated user list. The configuration specifies. Please try to reconfigure the details and ensure a filename is provided.
Unknown authentication method '%s'
The specified regular expression is wrong. Please double check it.
Handler secdownload needs a secret
You must define a passphrase to be used as shared secret between the Hidden Downloads handler and the script you use to generate the URLs.
It looks like you've hit a bug in the server. Please, do not hesitate to report it at http://bugs.cherokee-project.com/ so  the developer team can fix it.
Your configuration file is either broken, obsolete or has been tampered with. You need to reconfigure the verbosity of your ServerInfo handler.
Parsing error: unknown version
Found a FastCGI handler without a Load Balancer
HTTP Error %d redirection: An 'url' property is required
Either the directory where your theme resides has been deleted, or the permissions are wrong.
Most likely someone has inadvertedly deleted some of the files of your theme. Please try to restore the files or change your theme selection.
Cherokee's POST status reporter supports a number of output languages and formats, including: JSON, Python, PHP and Ruby.
Cherokee's DBSlayer supports a number of output languages and formats, including: JSON, Python, PHP and Ruby. Please reconfigure the DBSlayer rule to match one of those.
DBSlayer handler needs a balancer
The DBSlayer handler needs must specify a load balancing strategy and a list of target hosts to attend the load. At least one host is required. Please ensure it is correctly configured.
Handler custom error needs an HTTP error value.
Setting pipe properties fd=%d: '${errno}'
Most probably the server is not running as root, and therefore it cannot switch to a new user. If you want Cherokee to be able to change use UID to execute CGIs, you'll have to run it as root.
Wrong plug-in: The module must implement a handler.
The server tried to set a handler, but the loaded plug-in contained another sort of module.
The Load Balancer cannot be empty
Balancer defined without a value
Balancer: No '%s' log has been defined.
For some reason the load balancer module is using a missing Information Source. Please recheck that it uses a correct one.
Taking source='%s' back on-line
The information source is being re-enabled.
The information source is being disabled.
All the Information Sources have been off-lined. The server needs to re-enable at least one of them.
The server did not found a valid initialization value for the encoder
Logger: No '%s' log has been defined.

Since you are trying to use a custom logging template, providing the template is mandatory.
Could not parse custom log: '%s'
The server found a problem while processing the logging template. Please ensure it is correct.
epoll_ctl: ep_fd %d, fd %d: '${errno}'
Could not set CloseExec to the epoll descriptor: fcntl: '${errno}'
fd_associate: fd %d: '${errno}'
port_associate: fd %d: '${errno}'
The server reached the file descriptor limit. This usaully happens when many simultaneous connections are kept open. Try to increase this limit.
Could not remove fd %d (idx=%d) from the poll
EvHost needs a 'tpl_document_root property'
EvHost: Could not parse template '%s'
Could not parse the template definining how virtual servers are located. You need to re-define the Dynamic Document Root for your Advanced Virtual Hosting.

The rule found an entry with an unsupported type. Probably the configuration file has been tampered with.
Could not parse 'from' entry: '%s'
The entries of this rule must be either IP address or network masks. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and masks are supported.
Rule prio=%d type='bind', invalid port='%s'
Group '%s' not found in the system
Seem like you've specified a wrong GID. Change the specified one or try to create it using the addgroup/groupadd command.
User '%s' not found in the system
Looks like you've specified a wrong UID. Either change the specified one or try to create it using the adduser/useradd command.
Ignoring thread_policy entry '%s'
It looks like an error ocurred with the selected OS thread policy and it has been ignored. Once a valid one is selected, the issue will be fixed.
The specified OS thread policy is unknown. You should try re-selecting one.
An incorrect server token was specified. Please choose one that is available in you Network behavior settings.
Polling method '%s' has not been recognized
An incorrect polling method was specified. Please try to fix that in your advanced settings.
Polling method '%s' is not supported by this OS
The specified polling method does not work on your platform. Please try to choose another one in your advanced settings.
The web server needs to be associated to a TCP port. Please try to specify that in your general settings.
No TLS backend is specified, but the configuration specifies a secure port and it is being ignored. Either enable a TLS backend or disable the TLS checkbox for the specified port.
TLS/SSL support required for 'default' Virtual Server.
TLS/SSL support must be set up in the 'default' Virtual Server. Its certificate will be used by the server in case TLS SNI information is not provided by the client.
Virtual Server '%s' is trying to use SSL/TLS, but no Crypto engine is active.
For a Virtual Server to use SSL/TLS, a Crypto engine must be available server-wide.
Server parser: Unknown key '%s'
initgroups: Unable to set groups for user '%s' and GID %d
cannot change group to GID %d, running with GID=%d
Most probably you the server did not have enough permissions to change its execution group.
cannot change group to UID %d, running with UID=%d
Most probably you the server did not have enough permissions to change its execution user.
Could not get File Descriptor limit
The server FD limit seems to be higher than the system limit
The opened file descriptor limit of the server is %d, while the limit of the system is %d. This is an unlikely situation. You could try to raise the opened file descriptor limit of your system.
The FD limit of the thread is greater than the limit of the poll
It seems that an internal server thread assumed a file descriptor limit of %d. However, its FD poll has a lower limit of %d descriptors. The limit has been reduced to the poll limit.
Could not create an internal server thread
This is a extremely unusual error. For some reason the server could not create a thread while launching the server.
cannot initialize TLS for '%s' virtual host
This is usually caused by an error with a certificate or private key.
Unable to raise file descriptor limit to %d
Unable to read the file descriptor limit of the system
The number of available file descriptors is too low
The number of available file descriptors: %d, is too low. At least there should be %d available. Please, try to raise your system file descriptor limit.
Could not get information about the UID %d
Could not chroot() to '%s': '${errno}'
Could not chdir() to '%s': '${errno}'
Source %d: An entry 'type' is required

There should exist at least one virtual server.
Lowest priority virtual server must be 'default'
The lowest priority virtual server should be named 'default'.
Could not execute the Panic handler: '%s', status %d
Something happened with the server, and it felt panic. It tried to call an external program to report it to the administrator, but it failed.
The server is configured to execute an interpreter as a different user. However, it seems that the user does not exist in the system.
The server is configured to execute an interpreter as a different group. However, it seems that the group does not exist in the system.
There is a 'Interpreter Source' witout an interpreter.
The server configuration defines an 'interpreter' information source that does not specify an interpreter.
Could not find interpreter '%s'
The server configuration refers to an interpreter that is not installed in this system.
The command to launch the interpreter contains environment variables
Please remove the environment variables from the command, and add them as such.
The configuration file '%s' could not be accessed. Most probably the server user does not have enough permissions to read it.
'%s' and '%s' as child of the same node
The server could not parse the configuration. Something must be wrong with formation. At this stage the lexical is checked.
It seems that the template uses an undefined token.
Could not open temporal file '%s': ${errno}
It looks like the cherokee supervisor is not running, or it could not create the required temporal file.
Could not unlock spawning semaphore %d: ${errno}
Please, specify a default icon. It is the icon that Cherokee will use whenever no other icon is used.
Could not assign suffix '%s' to file '%s'
An unexpected error has just occurred in the server. The cause of the issue is unknown. Please, do not hesitate to report it at http://bugs.cherokee-project.com/ so the developer team can fix it.
Duped suffix (case insensitive) '%s', pointing to '%s'

Unknown ret %d from handler %s
The server is under heavy load and it has run out of file descriptors. It can be fixed by raising the file descriptor limit and restarting the server.
Trying to get a new connection object
Either the system run out of memory, or you've hit a bug in the code.
Could not create a system thread: '${errno}'
This is a extremely unusual error. For some reason your system could not create a thread while launching the server. You might have hit some system restriction.
Could not build the local directory string
Could not get virtual server: '%s'
pstat_getdynamic() failed: '${errno}'
sysctl(CTL_HW:HW_NCPU) failed: '${errno}'

AVL Tree inconsistency: Balance
Buffer: Bad memory estimation. The format '%s' estimated a negative length: %d.
Buffer: No target memory. The format '%s' got a free size of %d (estimated %d).
Buffer: Bad estimation. Too few memory: '%s' -> '%s', esti=%d real=%d size=%d.
Buffer: Bad estimation: Estimation=%d, needed=%d available size=%d: %s.
Could not open the file: %s, ${errno}
Please check that the file exists and the server has read access.
Could not read from fd: read(%d, %d, ..) = ${errno}
The server found an internal problem. 
Something just happened while opening a plug-in file
The operating system reported '%s' while trying to load '%s'.
The plug-in initialization function (%s) could not be found
Could not open the '%s' module
Either you are trying to use an unavailable (uninstalled?) plugin, or there is a installation issue.
Could not access the 'info' entry of the %s plug-in
For some reason the configuration file is trying to use an invalid authentication method. Either the file has been tampered with, or you are using a legacy configuration from a system that was compiled with support for more authentication methods.
Expiration time without a 'time' property
The expiration time feature is being used but no amount of time has been specified. Either provide on or disable Expiration.
Virtual Server Rule, Unknown key '%s'
Most probably you are using an old configuration file that contains a deprecated key. Loading and then saving it through Cherokee-Admin should update the old entries for you automatically.
Rule matches must specify a 'type' property
For some reason the rule is incomplete. Try editing or recreating it within Cherokee-Admin.
Could not load rule module '%s'
The server could not load a plug-in file. This might be due to some problem in the installation.
For some reason your configuration file contains invalid priority values, which must be an integer higher than 0. Most likely it has been edited by hand and the value must be fixed manually or the rule has to be discarded.
Rules must specify a 'match' property
For some reason there is an incomplete rule in your configuration file. Try locating it in Cherokee-Admin and fill in all the mandatory fields.
Virtual Server must specify a 'match' property
Try filling in the fields under the 'Host Match' tab.
Virtual Server, Unknown key '%s'
Virtual Server  without a 'nick' property
For some reason, a mandatory property is not present in your configuration. Fill in the 'Virtual Server nickname' field, under the 'Basics' tab.
Virtual Server  without a 'document_root' property
You seem to have forgotten to provide a valid Document Root. This is the root path that contains the files and directories that will be made publicly available through the web server. It can be an empty path and even /dev/null, but it is a mandatory property.
Unknown Front-Line Cache caching policy: %s
Could not compile <<%s>>: %s (offset=%d)
For some reason, PCRE could not compile the regular expression. Please modify the regular expression in order to solve this problem.
This IP '%s' is IPv6-mapped IPv6 address
It can be solved by specifying the IP in IPv4 style: a.b.c.d, instead of IPv6 style: ::ffff:a.b.c.d style
The IP address '%s' seems to be invalid
You must have made a mistake. Please, try to fix the IP and try again.
The network mask '%s' seems to be invalid
It seems that the configuration file includes a port listening entry with the wrong format. It should contain one port specification, but it does not in this case.
Could not bind() port=%d (UID=%d, GID=%d)
Most probably there is another web server listening to the same port. You will have to shut it down before launching Cherokee. It could also be a permissions issue as well. Remember that non-root user cannot listen to ports < 1024.
Could not execute RRD command: %s
RRDtool replied an error message: %s
Could not create the RRD working thread: error=%d
Could not create the RRD working mutex: error=%d

Make sure that a MySQL query has been provided.
MySQL validator misconfigured: A Host or Unix socket is needed.
Make sure that a working database host is specified for MySQL validation.
Unable to connect to MySQL server: %s:%d %s
Most probably the MySQL server is down or you've mistyped a connetion parameter
Accepted parameter are 's' and 'd'
Not enough entropy in the pool
Could not get the socket struct: %p
Servername did not match: '%s'
A TLS negotiation using SNI is sending a domain name that does not match any of the available ones. This makes it impossible to present a certificate with a correct CA. Check the list of TLS enabled Virtual Servers if you expect otherwise.
Could not change the SSL context: servername='%s'
OpenSSL: Could not allocate OpenSSL context
OpenSSL: cannot set cipher list '%s': %s
OpenSSL: cannot use certificate file '%s':  %s
An error occured while trying to load a certificate into the SSL context structure. Most likely the certificate file is wrong or has been corrupted.
OpenSSL: cannot use private key file '%s': %s
An error occured while trying to load a private key the SSL context structure. Most likely the file is wrong or has been corrupted.
OpenSSL: Private key does not match the certificate public key
The private key must agree with the corresponding public key in the certificate associated with a specific SSL context. Double check both private key and certificate.
OpenSSL: cannot read trusted CA list '%s': %s
If this happens, CA certificates for verification purposes cannot be located. It is likely there is a problem with your private key.
SSL_load_client_CA_file '%s': %s
A file of PEM formatted certificates should be read to extract data of the certificates found. It is likely there is a problem with your private key.
Unable to set SSL session-id context for '%s': %s
Could not activate TLS SNI for '%s': %s
It looks like Cherokee was compiled with TLS SNI support. However, it is currently using a SSL library (libssl/openssl) without TLS SNI support, and thus SNI is disabled.
OpenSSL: Unable to create a new SSL connection from the SSL context: %s
OpenSSL: cannot set fd(%d): %s
SSL_write: unknown errno: ${errno}
SSL_write (%d, ..) -> err=%d '%s'
SSL_read: unknown errno: ${errno}
OpenSSL: SSL_read (%d, ..) -> err=%d '%s'
