The DBSlayer handler needs must specify a load balancing strategy and a list of target hosts to attend the load. At least one host is required. Please ensure it is correctly configured.
Handler custom error needs an HTTP error value.
Setting pipe properties fd=%d: '${errno}'
Most probably the server is not running as root, and therefore it cannot switch to a new user. If you want Cherokee to be able to change use UID to execute CGIs, you'll have to run it as root.
Wrong plug-in: The module must implement a handler.
The server tried to set a handler, but the loaded plug-in contained another sort of module.
The Load Balancer cannot be empty
Balancer defined without a value
Balancer: No '%s' log has been defined.
For some reason the load balancer module is using a missing Information Source. Please recheck that it uses a correct one.
Taking source='%s' back on-line

You must define an access list in order to activate the X-Real-IP support.
A template is needed for logging connections: %s
Since you are trying to use a custom logging template, providing the template is mandatory.
Could not parse custom log: '%s'
The server found a problem while processing the logging template. Please ensure it is correct.
epoll_ctl: ep_fd %d, fd %d: '${errno}'
Could not set CloseExec to the epoll descriptor: fcntl: '${errno}'
fd_associate: fd %d: '${errno}'
port_associate: fd %d: '${errno}'
The server reached the file descriptor limit. This usaully happens when many simultaneous connections are kept open. Try to increase this limit.
Could not remove fd %d (idx=%d) from the poll
EvHost needs a 'tpl_document_root property'

Seem like you've specified a wrong GID. Change the specified one or try to create it using the addgroup/groupadd command.
User '%s' not found in the system
Looks like you've specified a wrong UID. Either change the specified one or try to create it using the adduser/useradd command.
Ignoring thread_policy entry '%s'
It looks like an error ocurred with the selected OS thread policy and it has been ignored. Once a valid one is selected, the issue will be fixed.
The specified OS thread policy is unknown. You should try re-selecting one.
An incorrect server token was specified. Please choose one that is available in you Network behavior settings.
Polling method '%s' has not been recognized
An incorrect polling method was specified. Please try to fix that in your advanced settings.
Polling method '%s' is not supported by this OS
The specified polling method does not work on your platform. Please try to choose another one in your advanced settings.

Most probably you the server did not have enough permissions to change its execution group.
cannot change group to UID %d, running with UID=%d
Most probably you the server did not have enough permissions to change its execution user.
Could not get File Descriptor limit
The server FD limit seems to be higher than the system limit
The opened file descriptor limit of the server is %d, while the limit of the system is %d. This is an unlikely situation. You could try to raise the opened file descriptor limit of your system.
The FD limit of the thread is greater than the limit of the poll
It seems that an internal server thread assumed a file descriptor limit of %d. However, its FD poll has a lower limit of %d descriptors. The limit has been reduced to the poll limit.
Could not create a cherokee_thread_t
This is a extremely unusual error. For some reason the server could not create a thread while launching the server.
cannot initialize TLS for '%s' virtual host
This is usually caused by an error with a certificate or private key.
Unable to raise file descriptor limit to %d
Unable to read the file descriptor limit of the system
The number of available file descriptors is too low
The number of available file descriptors: %d, is too low. At least there should be %d available. Please, try to raise your system file descriptor limit.

The server is configured to execute an interpreter as a different user. However, it seems that the user does not exist in the system.
The server is configured to execute an interpreter as a different group. However, it seems that the group does not exist in the system.
There is a 'Interpreter Source' witout an interpreter.
The server configuration defines an 'interpreter' information source that does not specify an interpreter.
Could not find interpreter '%s'
The server configuration refers to an interpreter that is not installed in this system.
The configuration file '%s' could not be accessed. Most probably the server user does not have enough permissions to read it.
'%s' and '%s' as child of the same node
The server could not parse the configuration. Something must be wrong with formation. At this stage the lexical is checked.
It seems that the template uses an undefined token.
Could not initialize SHM '%s': ${errno}
Check if your shared memory is mounted in /dev/shm
Could not unlock spawning semaphore %d: ${errno}
Please, specify a default icon. It is the icon that Cherokee will use whenever no other icon is used.

Please check that the file exists and the server has read access.
Could not read from fd: read(%d, %d, ..) = ${errno}
The server found an internal problem. 
Something just happened while opening a plug-in file
The operating system reported '%s' while trying to load '%s'.
The plug-in initialization function (%s) could not be found
Could not open the '%s' module
Either you are trying to use an unavailable (uninstalled?) plugin, or there is a installation issue.
Could not access the 'info' entry of the %s plug-in
For some reason the configuration file is trying to use an invalid authentication method. Either the file has been tampered with, or you are using a legacy configuration from a system that was compiled with support for more authentication methods.
Expiration time without a 'time' property
The expiration time feature is being used but no amount of time has been specified. Either provide on or disable Expiration.
Virtual Server Rule, Unknown key '%s'
Most probably you are using an old configuration file that contains a deprecated key. Loading and then saving it through Cherokee-Admin should update the old entries for you automatically.
Rule matches must specify a 'type' property
For some reason the rule is incomplete. Try editing or recreating it within Cherokee-Admin.
Could not load rule module '%s'
The server could not load a plug-in file. This might be due to some problem in the installation.
For some reason your configuration file contains invalid priority values, which must be an integer higher than 0. Most likely it has been edited by hand and the value must be fixed manually or the rule has to be discarded.
Rules must specify a 'match' property
For some reason there is an incomplete rule in your configuration file. Try locating it in Cherokee-Admin and fill in all the mandatory fields.
Virtual Server must specify a 'match' property
Try filling in the fields under the 'Host Match' tab.
Virtual Server, Unknown key '%s'
Virtual Server  without a 'nick' property
For some reason, a mandatory property is not present in your configuration. Fill in the 'Virtual Server nickname' field, under the 'Basics' tab.
Virtual Server  without a 'document_root' property
You seem to have forgotten to provide a valid Document Root. This is the root path that contains the files and directories that will be made publicly available through the web server. It can be an empty path and even /dev/null, but it is a mandatory property.
Could not compile <<%s>>: %s (offset=%d)
For some reason, PCRE could not compile the regular expression. Please modify the regular expression in order to solve this problem.
This IP '%s' is IPv6-mapped IPv6 address
It can be solved by specifying the IP in IPv4 style: a.b.c.d, instead of IPv6 style: ::ffff:a.b.c.d style
The IP address '%s' seems to be invalid
You must have made a mistake. Please, try to fix the IP and try again.
The network mask '%s' seems to be invalid
It seems that the configuration file includes a port listening entry with the wrong format. It should contain one port specification, but it does not in this case.
Could not bind() port=%d (UID=%d, GID=%d)
Most probably there is another web server listening to the same port. You will have to shut it down before launching Cherokee. It could also be a permissions issue as well. Remember that non-root user cannot listen to ports < 1024.
Could not execute RRD command: %s
RRDtool replied an error message: %s

Most probably the MySQL server is down or you've mistyped a connetion parameter
Accepted parameter are 's' and 'd'
Could not get the socket struct: %p
Servername did not match: '%s'
A TLS negotiation using SNI is sending a domain name that does not match any of the available ones. This makes it impossible to present a certificate with a correct CA. Check the list of TLS enabled Virtual Servers if you expect otherwise.
Could not change the SSL context: servername='%s'
OpenSSL: Could not allocate OpenSSL context
OpenSSL: cannot set cipher list '%s': %s
OpenSSL: cannot use certificate file '%s':  %s
An error occured while trying to load a certificate into the SSL context structure. Most likely the certificate file is wrong or has been corrupted.
OpenSSL: cannot use private key file '%s': %s
An error occured while trying to load a private key the SSL context structure. Most likely the file is wrong or has been corrupted.
OpenSSL: Private key does not match the certificate public key
The private key must agree with the corresponding public key in the certificate associated with a specific SSL context. Double check both private key and certificate.
OpenSSL: cannot read trusted CA list '%s': %s
If this happens, CA certificates for verification purposes cannot be located. It is likely there is a problem with your private key.
