  Authenticate(password[,options[,maxdigits]]): This application asks the caller
to enter a given password in order to continue dialplan execution. If the password
begins with the '/' character, it is interpreted as a file which contains a list of
valid passwords, listed 1 password per line in the file.
  When using a database key, the value associated with the key can be anything.
Users have three attempts to authenticate before the channel is hung up.
  Options:
     a - Set the channels' account code to the password that is entered
     d - Interpret the given path as database key, not a literal file
     m - Interpret the given path as a file which contains a list of account
         codes and password hashes delimited with ':', listed one per line in
         the file. When one of the passwords is matched, the channel will have
         its account code set to the corresponding account code in the file.
     r - Remove the database key upon successful entry (valid with 'd' only)
     maxdigits  - maximum acceptable number of digits. Stops reading after
         maxdigits have been entered (without requiring the user to
         press the '#' key).
         Defaults to 0 - no limit - wait for the user press the '#' key.
