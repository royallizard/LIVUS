  Record(filename.format,silence[,maxduration][,options])
Records from the channel into a given filename. If the file exists it will
be overwritten.
- 'format' is the format of the file type to be recorded (wav, gsm, etc).
- 'silence' is the number of seconds of silence to allow before returning.
- 'maxduration' is the maximum recording duration in seconds. If missing
or 0 there is no maximum.
- 'options' may contain any of the following letters:
     'a' : append to existing recording rather than replacing
     'n' : do not answer, but record anyway if line not yet answered
     'q' : quiet (do not play a beep tone)
     's' : skip recording if the line is not yet answered
     't' : use alternate '*' terminator key (DTMF) instead of default '#'
     'x' : ignore all terminator keys (DTMF) and keep recording until hangup
If filename contains '%d', these characters will be replaced with a number
incremented by one each time the file is recorded. A channel variable
named RECORDED_FILE will also be set, which contains the final filemname.
Use 'core show file formats' to see the available formats on your system
User can press '#' to terminate the recording and continue to the next priority.
If the user should hangup during a recording, all data will be lost and the
application will teminate.
